The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as
resolution 2405 (2018).

Recalling the Security Council?€?s latest note 507 on
its working methods (S/2017/507), I wish to encourage
all participants, both members and non-members of the
Council, to deliver their statements in five minutes or
less. Note 507 also encourages briefers to be succinct and
to focus on key issues. Briefers are further encouraged
to limit initial remarks to 15 minutes or less."
7,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,6,,,,,,,,"I now give the floor to Mr. Yamamoto.

Mr. Yamamoto: I would like to thank you, Madam
President, for scheduling this meeting on Afghanistan
on International Women?€?s Day. I wish to express my
appreciation for Minister Kaag?€?s initiative to lead an
all-women delegation today and to encourage other
members to do the same. I am also very pleased that
the Afghan delegation is joined today by Ms. Sarabi
and Ms. Safi. They are two women with distinguished
careers in working for the advancement of peace
in Afghanistan."
8,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,7,,,,,,,,"The members of the Council witnessed for
themselves the importance of women?€?s rights and
women?€?s empowerment during their recent visit to
Kabul. I am sure that they were deeply impressed, as I
am, by the resilience of Afghan women, whose strength
holds the fabric of society together. I will touch on
the women, peace and security agenda throughout
my briefing."
9,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,8,,,,,,,,"A week ago, Afghanistan successfully hosted the
second conference of the Kabul Process for peace and
security. All conference participants endorsed the call
for direct talks between the Government and the Taliban
without preconditions. All relevant parties, including
the Taliban, agree that a negotiated political settlement
is the way to bring an end to the conflict."
10,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,9,,,,,,,,"President Ashraf Ghani offered peace to the
Taliban without preconditions and laid out a path for
negotiations, with a series of concrete proposals, to"
11,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,10,,,,,,,,"create a space for the opening of talks. The offer of
negotiations is on the table. It is now incumbent upon
the Taliban to come forward with an offer of their own
and to start direct talks with the Government in order
to put an end to the suffering of the Afghan people. The
Taliban?€?s argument that they will not talk to the Afghan
Government because the conflict is not between Afghan
parties misrepresents the reality that tens of thousands
of Afghan people are killed and maimed every year
in direct confrontations between the Taliban and the
Government forces."
12,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,11,,,,,,,,"Making peace and reaching out to opponents
requires resolve, courage and, above all, national
unity. Looking at recent developments in domestic
political, I am compelled to express my concern about
some actions that could deepen divisions in society.
Political leaders need to place the national interest
above a partisan agenda. National unity provides the
only basis for the continuation of international support
to Afghanistan and for the implementation of effective
reforms. Political stability also requires inclusivity. The
prolonged political impasse over the governorship of
Balkh should be resolved swiftly through a negotiated
solution. It must not undermine the authority of the
National Unity Government or hinder progress on the
delivery of key Government functions. The upcoming
elections provide a further opportunity to ensure
that unity and stability prevail and that all groups
are represented."
13,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,12,,,,,,,,"When the members of the Council visited
Afghanistan in January, they delivered aclear and strong
message that parliamentary elections must be held in
2018 and presidential elections in 2019. Since then,
there has been accelerated progress on preparations
for voter registration. The Independent Election
Commission, under its new Chairperson, is working
hard on electoral preparations, but the timelines remain
tight. In one of his first statements, the Chairperson of
the Commission acknowledged that elections would
most probably have to be delayed beyond the current
date of July 2018 but that they could still be held this
year as long as preparations are not delayed and voter
registration begins on schedule in April."
14,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,13,,,,,,,,"The Independent Election Commission must also
concentrate on areas where it can deliver and seek the
assistance of other agencies of the Government in areas
that need to be accelerated, such as the recruitment
of voter registration staff. The Afghanistan Central
Civil Registration Authority must now do all it can to"
15,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,14,,,,,,,,"enable eligible Afghan citizens to register to vote by
issuing citizen identity cards, known in Afghanistan
as tazkeras, to the millions of people who do not
possess them. Public outreach is important. Afghan
voters will need to understand the importance for them
to cast their votes, even though they may have serious
concerns about the electoral system because of past
experiences. The United Nations is working with the
Commission to ensure women?€?s participation in all
stages of the elections ?€? as candidates, campaigners
and voters."
16,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,15,,,,,,,,"The new penal code, which entered into force on
14 February, reinforces Afghanistan?€?s compliance
with international human rights and criminal justice
standards and is a milestone in the country?€?s criminal
justice reform. We wholeheartedly welcome its coming
into force. UNAMA played a valuable role in drafting
the code. I am pleased to report, on today?€?s International
Women?€?s Day, that the Afghan Cabinet has adopted the
necessary amendment to the penal code to ensure that
all provisions of the Elimination of Violence against
Women law continue to apply, giving Afghan women
continuing legal protection from violence."
17,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,16,,,,,,,,"Women are also disproportionately affected by
the conflict. More than 1,200 women were killed or
injured last year, mostly from ground fighting and
suicide attacks. I am particularly concerned by the
increase in civilian casualties caused by the Islamic
State in Khorasan Province, which has been expanding
its geographical spread beyond the hitherto stronghold
of eastern Afghanistan into northern Afghanistan. We
are monitoring those developments very carefully in
the light of potentially destabilizing effects in the north
and beyond."
18,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,17,,,,,,,,"I would like to turn to another issue of pressing
importance, which is the question of refugees and
displaced persons. Pakistan and Iran have generously
hosted Afghan refugees for decades in times of great
needs, and we appreciate their contribution. It should
not be forgotten that 1.5 million people returned to
Afghanistan in 2016 and 2017. The Afghan Government
has welcomed the return of its citizens, but such large
numbers inevitably stress the Government?€?s ability
to provide services. Assurances that returnees would
gain access to land, housing and basic services have
unfortunately not been realized. We believe that gap
must be addressed before encouraging more people to
move back to their homeland voluntarily. It is possible,
and even likely, that hundreds of thousands more"
19,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,18,,,,,,,,"Afghans will return from Pakistan this year alone.
While the international aid community is preparing
contingency plans to provide short-term help, the
responsibility for people?€?s protection and welfare rests
with the State. Simply put, only the State can provide
land, guarantee property rights and ensure adequate
provision of services."
20,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,19,,,,,,,,"With regard to investment and improving
Afghanistan?€?s economy, I am _ pleased to _ note
the recent ground-breaking ceremony for the

construction in Afghanistan of the Turkmenistan-
Afghanistan-Pakistan-India pipeline. The nearly
2,000-kilometre-long pipeline will be able to transfer
33 billion cubic metres of gas from Turkmenistan to
Pakistan and India through Afghanistan. The ground-
breaking was not only a success for regional cooperation
and integration, but the beginning of the fulfilment
of a long-standing project in Afghanistan that will
contribute significantly to Afghanistan?€?s economic
self-reliance."
21,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,20,,,,,,,,"UNAMA appreciate?€?s the Council?€?s adoption of
a renewed mandate for UNAMA. We have important
tasks ahead of us this year, including peace efforts, the
upcoming elections and the ministerial conference on
Afghanistan, which the United Nations looks forward to
hosting with the Government of Afghanistan in Geneva
on 28 November. I must also mention the critical areas
of human rights and reforms, including with regard to
anti-corruption efforts. As we work with and for the
people and the Government of Afghanistan, we look to
the Security Council to provide us with a clear mandate."
22,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,21,,,,,,,,"The President:
his briefing.

I thank Mr. Yamamoto for

I now give the floor to Ms. Sarabi.

Ms. Sarabi: It is indeed an honour for me to be
here today to represent Afghan women. I thank the
delegation of the Netherlands for the opportunity to
participate in this meeting."
23,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,22,,,,,,,,"Iam very hopeful that the Security Council gained
a very clear picture of the situation during its their last
visit to Kabul. I thank the Council for coming to visit
us. Surely, that will pave the way for new opportunities
to reiterate the Council?€?s support for the people of
Afghanistan, especially women. Women?€?s lives have
changed remarkably in the past 17 years, and two
factors are responsible for that change."
24,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,23,,,,,,,,"One of them is the tireless efforts and persistent
struggles of women themselves; the other is the
Afghanistan?€?s Constitution, which includes important
articles in favour of women that have enabled them to
become engaged in political and social issues in the
country. In addition to the Afghan Constitution, which
provides equal rights for both Afghan men and women,
on 5 March 2003, Afghanistan joined the Convention
on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination
against Women. In addition, laws were adopted on
eliminating violence against women and preventing
sexual harassment."
25,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,24,,,,,,,,"Afghanistan today is well equipped with national
policies and international commitments to support
women?€?s empowerment. Afghanistan?€?s Constitution
guarantees equal rights before the law for both women
and men. Similarly, the Constitution guarantees
women?€?s access to education, health care and social
inclusion. After 17 years, Afghanistan has in place
key legislation, policies and national plans that further
increase the Government?€?s obligation to strengthen
women?€?s participation and equal rights."
26,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,25,,,,,,,,"Afghan women?€?s inclusion in some of the key
decision-making roles at the central and provincial
levels is remarkable. Women?€?s presence today in
the Cabinet, the Parliament, the Senate, provincial
councils, the High Peace Council, the security sector
and civil society is also remarkable. The post of Deputy
Attorney General for the prohibition of violence against
women has been established, and there are currently 242
women prosecutors working in different departments,
including that on the elimination of violence against
women. There are also 300 female judges, who are
working to ensure the rule of law and prevent violence
against women. In addition, 800 out of 4,000 defence
attorneys are female. In addition, family response units
are actively working throughout all 34 provinces. With
regard to the security sector, a total of 3,144 female
police officers are working in the Ministry of the
Interior, with a target to increase that number to 5,000.
And 1,500 women are currently playing an active role
in the Ministry of Defence."
27,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,26,,,,,,,,"The Government?€?s initiatives have led to significant
achievements in education and training, which translate
into an increase in the number of girls attending school
from 3.5 million in 2013 to 3.6 million in 2015 ?€? 40 per
cent of the total number of students attending school.
Young girls continue to pursue higher education after
graduating from school, either in the country or abroad."
28,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,27,,,,,,,,"The number of professors in governmental universities
increased from 3,159 to 5,582 in three years, of whom
774 are female. It is worth mentioning that the National
Unity Government has not limited women just to the
Ministry of Women?€?s Affairs, and that the role of
women in governance has expanded to all departments.
For example, a 50 per cent presence of women in
the Citizens Charter National Priority Programme
is guaranteed."
29,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,28,,,,,,,,"In July 2015, the Government of Afghanistan
launched its first national action plan for the
implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). The
plan involves collaboration with other Government
agencies, civil society organizations and international
organizations to implement resolution 1325 (2000). In
Government leadership, there are 3 female Ministers
and 11 female Deputy Ministers, but what is worth
mentioning is the significant presence of women at the
middle-management level."
30,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,29,,,,,,,,"Afghan women have made significant progress in
small and medium-sized businesses. For example, the
Chamber of Commerce for Women has been established
to empower and support Afghan women in business.
We are proud of the growth of the role of women in civil
society. Although they are still young, their advocacy
skills are commendable. An estimated 2,000 female
employees are actively working in the media sector,
where up to 50 print, video and audio media outlets are
run by women."
31,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,30,,,,,,,,"Women?€?s participation in sports is another tangible
achievement. The number of Afghan girls in sports now
exceeds 12,000, and in the past three years they have
won 50 foreign medals. Sportswomen have been well
represented in various sports, especially the Bamyan
Mountain Peace Cup bicycle-racing championship."
32,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,31,,,,,,,,"Women are actively engaged in the peace process.
Out of a total of 65 members of the High Peace Council,
one in a leadership position, four in the executive and
twelve in the General Assembly are women. Sixty-three
women out of 320 are also members of the Provincial
Peace Committee. Right now, women are represented at
all levels of the High Peace Council. In the High Peace
Council, the leadership and all members ?€? including
myself as a Deputy Chairperson ?€? have always
maintained and respected the idea that peace without
women?€?s meaningful participation is impossible.
Therefore, we are committed to boosting women?€?s role
at all levels of the peacebuilding process, ensuring"
33,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,32,,,,,,,,"their participation in leadership and safeguarding
their rights.

The High Peace Council and I also believe that
social peace is paving the way for political peace. That
is why we initiated the Women?€?s Peace Network, which
we call the ?€?mothers of peace?€?. The first phase is now
complete and the second will start very soon, in late
March. The Network will bring changes to the mindset
of the people from one of violence to one of peace."
34,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,33,,,,,,,,"The High Peace Council has also created a women?€?s
advisory board, where rural women from 34 provinces,
in addition to Provincial Peace Committee members,
will meet on a quarterly basis and share their concerns
and ideas for improving our operations. We are
committed to increasing the number of female members
in the Committee from two to three in each province.

At the second Kabul Process conference, the
Afghan Government shared the road map for peace.
Afghan President Ashraf Ghani offered talks with the
Taliban without preconditions. He added:"
35,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,34,,,,,,,,"?€?The Taliban will be recognized as a political
party in the structure of the Constitution and by the
Afghan Government if they obey the rule of law and
respect women?€?s rights, which is one of the strategic
priorities for Afghanistan?€?s international partners.?€?

Also, one of the subjects mentioned in the proposal is
a provision for the rights and safety of all citizens of
Afghanistan, especially women, in accordance with
the Constitution."
36,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,35,,,,,,,,"These are achievements for Afghan women, but
some challenges remain and I shall highlight just the
principal ones. First, violence against women remains
very high throughout Afghanistan. Secondly, there is a
lack of awareness and rule of law for the implementation
of gender equality. Thirdly, access to higher education
is difficult, especially for girls who are married young
and cannot pursue their education. Fourthly, election
campaigning for women, especially in rural areas, is
still a challenge.

Ishouldlike to make the followingrecommendations.

We must ensure that women?€?s rights are
non-negotiable at any level of the peace dialogue.
We must make a commitment to including women?€?s
meaningful participation in all agendas at the
negotiating table and in decision-making in peace
and reconciliation processes. We must ensure that the"
37,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,36,,,,,,,,"female members of the Provincial Peace Committee
have the capacity to negotiate and lobby. We must also
ensure specific and sufficient allocation of budgets and
corresponding financing mechanisms for the effective
implementation of the national action plan on resolution
1325 (2000), and include women in initiatives related to
improving livelihoods and community-based projects
to strengthen development outcomes and address risks.

Afghan women expect their partners to stand by
them, bring peace and security and uproot the pervasive
phenomenon of terrorism, because if we are the primary
victims today, surely tomorrow others will be next."
38,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,37,,,,,,,,"The President: [ thank Ms. Sarabi for her briefing.
I now give the floor to Ms. Safi.

Ms. Safi: I thank you, Madam President, for giving
me the opportunity to address the Security Council
today. I should like to thank the Netherlands, as the
President of the Council this month, for inviting me to
share my perspectives on the Afghan peace process."
39,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,38,,,,,,,,"Today, in my capacity as a peacebuilder and
member of the research community in Afghanistan, I
would like to touch on the current trends, conditions on
the ground and key issues relating to the Afghan peace
process. The perspectives I will be sharing with the
Council today have been deeply informed by a decade
of consultations I have led as part of our efforts at the
Organization for Policy Research and Development
Studies with diverse sectors, community members and
the brave and resilient women of Afghanistan."
40,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,39,,,,,,,,"Afghanistan has witnessed great progress since
2001. This is reflected in the emergence of a bright
and vibrant new generation of youth, the representation
of women in all sectors of Afghan society and the
strengthening of a promising democratic system of
governance. Seventeen years ago, hope replaced despair
as Afghans embarked on the path towards a peaceful
and stable future where conflict would become a distant
memory. We welcomed international investment and
commitment to supporting that hope."
41,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,40,,,,,,,,"But as I speak here, I must tell Council members that
this hope is fading. The theater of conflict is becoming
more confusing, complicated and lethal. In 2001, we
were fighting one group; we are now fighting over 20
regional and international terrorist organizations. Safe
zones have now become battlefields that extend from
rural to urban areas. The Taliban, its affiliated group
the Haqqani Network, and fighters affiliated with the"
42,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,41,,,,,,,,"Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant are now targeting
civilians, including women and children.

In 2009, 285 women were killed as a result of the
ongoing conflict. As mentioned earlier, that number
rose to 1,224 in 2017. That is extremely alarming. Let us
not forget last year?€?s killing of 9-year-old Shukria, who,
while travelling with her family from Ghazni province
to Quetta, was stopped by insurgents, held captive and
later beheaded. That incident prompted nationwide
protests and made it very clear that Afghans would not
tolerate impunity for those targeting civilians."
43,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,42,,,,,,,,"Despite the Taliban committing to a code of conduct
on the protection of civilians, the group continues to
carry out attacks in densely populated areas, showing
no regard for civilian lives. I implore the Security
Council and the international community to ensure that
transitional justice is not compromised in the pursuit of
peace and reconciliation. The peace deal with Hizb-i
Islami, signed in September 2016, showed us that peace
is possible in Afghanistan. However, it also showed how
easily actors could sideline the need for community
healing, exclude women and civil society engagement
and take steps that reinforce a culture of impunity in
the pursuit of achieving peace."
44,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,43,,,,,,,,"While security challenges remain the predominant
source of concern, it is not the only cause of despair
among Afghans. Our recent findings indicate that
insecurity and political instability go hand in hand,
and are the two primary drivers for Afghans fleeing.
For the first time in Afghanistan?€?s history, we are now
witnessing young, single Afghan women making up a
significant portion of those undertaking the dangerous
journey out of the country."
45,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,44,,,,,,,,"As Ms. Sarabi just described, the second round
of the Kabul Process culminated last week with the
Afghan Government presenting a detailed offer of
peace to the Taliban for the first time. While there
has long been national consensus on the need for
peace among Afghans, there still remain serious and
diverging concerns on the best way forward for peace
to unfold. Fundamental questions remain on whether
the time is right for such negotiations. What are the red
lines for negotiations? What would justice look like in
an eventual settlement? How will the rights of women
be upheld and protected? How will the participation of
women at all levels be guaranteed in the implementation
and monitoring of any agreement reached? What is
the way forward after a peace agreement is reached,"
46,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,45,,,,,,,,"and what will that peace mean to different sectors of
Afghan society?

For women, it is imperative for the State to define
the type of peace that would ensue from reconciliation.
Our findings show that women believe that the future
of their rights is intricately tied to the outcomes of
the peace process. Habiba from Kunduz province
told us that the gains of the past 17 years in women?€?s
empowerment, freedom of speech, human rights and
civil values should not be open for negotiation. On
the question of reintegrating ex-combatants, women,
particularly those living in rural areas, expressed fear
of an escalation of violence and further suppression of
women. How those reintegrated would be monitored
after a peace agreement is also a significant source
of concern."
47,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,46,,,,,,,,"The Afghan Government?€?s launch of the national
action plan on resolution 1325 (2000), on women and
peace and security, in 2015 offered great possibilities
for the promotion of women?€?s involvement in all
areas related to peace and security. However, its
implementation continues to suffer setbacks, rendering
women?€?s voices as symbolic at decision-making levels.
For example, while gender units have been created
within most ministries in legal structures, they lack the
necessary tools and budget required to carry out the
mandate of resolution 1325 (2000). The time has come
to expand women?€?s roles from one of mere presence
to active engagement, consultation and inclusion. The
United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, the
Afghan Government and civil society organizations
must work together towards identifying where the
bottlenecks lie and adopt concrete and genuine measures
to address those gaps. Only then can we create spaces
where women, both formally and informally, are able to
realize their agency."
48,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,47,,,,,,,,"There is also a great disconnect between the
rhetoric of local ownership and how it is actually
implemented. The selective nature with which the High
Peace Council chooses the narratives it incorporates
into its peace agenda, the civil society actors it decides
to engage with and the priorities it chooses to focus on
have led many to question its legitimacy, credibility
and objectivity."
49,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,48,,,,,,,,"Real and meaningful progress notwithstanding,
the Afghan Government remains weak, with financial,
security and internal strife mounting. We must
therefore be cognizant that any proposed changes to the"
50,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,49,,,,,,,,"Constitution as a result of a peace agreement must not
erode the rights and freedoms of all Afghan citizens.
I appeal to the Security Council to closely monitor
any amendments to the Constitution, ensure that the
sequencing of peace-making activities and overtures
are supported with confidence-building measures from
the Taliban and, lastly, facilitate greater engagement
between the High Peace Council and diverse actors
of Afghan society to ensure that all narratives are
represented and supported through national consensus."
51,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,50,,,,,,,,"In conclusion, past experiences show us _ that
supporting an Afghan-led and Afghan-owned peace
process is not enough to prevent and combat terrorism.
When we asked women at the rural level what they
saw as an obstacle to achieving peace in Afghanistan,
almost all highlighted regional interference. The
Security Council and the international community
must persuade Pakistan to engage constructively in all
efforts to curb the threat of terrorism and support an
intra-Afghan dialogue for peace.

Afghanistan?€?s international partners have
repeatedly expressed their intention and will to stand
behind the people of Afghanistan to bring about lasting
peace, security and stability. Today, I urge those present
to stand beside us, and not behind us."
52,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,51,,,,,,,,"The President: I thank Ms. Safi for her briefing.

I now give the floor to the representative

of Afghanistan."
53,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,52,,,,,,,,"Mr. Saikal (Afghanistan): Let me begin by
congratulating the Netherlands on assuming the
presidency of the Security Council, and by thanking
you, Madam President, for convening today?€?s debate
on Afghanistan, which coincides with International
Women?€?s Day. We pay tribute today to the important
contributions of women in promoting stable and
prosperous societies. It is an occasion to focus on what
more needs to be done to empower women against the
many challenges they face, particularly in conflict and
post-conflict societies."
54,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,53,,,,,,,,"Iam pleased that Her Excellency Ms. Julie Bishop,
Minister for Foreign Affairs of Australia, will be
joining us later on, and my dear colleague, Ms. Habiba
Sarabi, Deputy Chairperson of Afghanistan?€?s High
Peace Council, and Ms. Mariam Safi are among us
here today. I thank the Special Representative of the
Secretary-General, Ambassador Tadamichi Yamamoto,
for his briefing.

Today?€?s meeting provides another occasion to
assess the overall situation in Afghanistan. I am pleased
to report that, in the course of the past three months,
the imperatives of Afghanistan?€?s security, stability and
development received added international attention,
with particular focus on addressing the root causes
of the conflict and strengthening our defensive and
security capabilities, in parallel with efforts to devise a
more practical peace plan."
55,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,54,,,,,,,,"Our security forces, with better support from
international partners, have increased pressure on
terrorist groups across the country. Nevertheless,
regional sponsors of terrorism, having faced
international pressure and setbacks in the countryside,
remain belligerent, as reflected by their efforts to
engineer violent attacks in urban centres with high
numbers of civilian casualties. Despite that, governance
reform and economic development have continued
unabated. A national dialogue among various political
forces has been under way on issues that are crucial
to our unity and political stability, the success of our
peace efforts and preparations for holding timely and
transparent parliamentary elections this year."
56,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,55,,,,,,,,"Afghanistan has always emphasized that our
partnership with the international community has been
a strategic asset for advancing shared goals of defeating
terrorism and achieving stability. In that light, the
Council?€?s visit to Kabul from 13 to 15 January and its
high-level meeting on 19 January on the security and
development of Afghanistan and Central Asia (see
S/PV.8162) were clear signs of international support
at the highest level. We are grateful to all members
of the Council for their collective commitment and
improved consensus on a more focused engagement on
key issues related to Afghanistan?€?s security, stability
and development. We wish to offer a special debt of
gratitude to my friend and colleague Ambassador
Kairat Umarov for his personal efforts in that regard as
President of the Council during the month of January."
57,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,56,,,,,,,,"During the Kabul visit, the Council discussed
a range of security, political, economic and social
issues with Afghanistan?€?s leadership in Government,
the Parliament, the judiciary, the High Peace Council,
political parties and civil society. One common request
pertained to effective Council action to address the
sponsorship of terrorist outfits and the problem of
their regional safe havens as priority needs for security
and stability in Afghanistan. That was highlighted by
Ms. Safi here today. It is also reflected in the recent"
58,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,57,,,,,,,,"report of the Secretary-General on the situation in
Afghanistan (S/2018/165).

Of late, we have seen new measures at the
international level to change the calculus and promote
genuine and productive counter-terrorism cooperation.
In that regard, recent decisions, including the reduction
of financial aid to the State concerned and its inclusion
in the watch list of the Financial Action Task Force
represent a renewed attempt to encourage genuine
action on the crucially important goal of defeating
terrorism effectively. We hope that the trend continues
and that the response to those measures is positive, in
the interest of peace and security in Afghanistan and
the region."
59,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,58,,,,,,,,"Days after the Council?€?s visit and almost
immediately after the 19 January high-level meeting
of the Council, regional sponsors of terrorism, through
their trained violent proxies, unleashed a new wave
of terrorist attacks. The sheer level of savagery in
those despicable and heinous attacks was startling.
Armed gunmen from the Taliban?€?s Haqqani Network
attacked the Intercontinental Hotel in Kabul, killing
18, including 14 foreign nationals, and wounding
many more. The subsequent week witnessed two more
barbaric attacks ?€? one in the Jalalabad compound of
the international non-governmental organization Save
the Children, where 27 people died, and the other was
an explosives-laden ambulance detonated next to a
major civilian hospital in the heart of Kabul. The blast
destroyed vehicles, shops and buildings nearby, killing
at least 105 civilians and injuring 235. The use of an
ambulance for such a ghastly attack is a war crime under
international law, including international humanitarian
law. The Council condemned the attacks and cited the
need to hold the perpetrators, organizers and financiers
of the attacks to account. Yet, despite all of the evidence
linking those attacks to regional sponsors, the question
once again is, When will that happen?"
60,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,59,,,,,,,,"Last week, Afghanistan convened the second
conference of the Kabul Process for peace and security.
That marked a major development in the context
of peace efforts aimed at ending the conflict and
achieving a credible and just peace that conforms to
the aspirations of all Afghans. In recognition of our
people?€?s demand for ending violence, President Ghani
reached out to the Taliban in an unprecedented manner,
calling for direct talks without preconditions. Should
his call receive a positive response, the Taliban will
be granted the chance to become normal citizens, to"
61,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,60,,,,,,,,"compete peacefully in politics through democratic
procedures, to be relieved of Security Council sanctions
measures and to enjoy the benefits of other positive
measures. In turn, they will have to give up their
long-standing path of violence. Moreover, our peace
process aims to protect and expand, not diminish, the
rights of our people, especially women. The time is
now for the Taliban to respond affirmatively and seize
the historic opportunity before them. We are inspired
by the international community?€?s level of support for
our new peace plan. The conference renewed the call
for tangible measures for combating terrorism, in
accordance with obligations stipulated in the United
Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and various
Security Council counter-terrorism resolutions. We
hope that States that have failed in that endeavour will
adopt a new approach based on express commitments
for the benefit of regional security."
62,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,61,,,,,,,,"For too long, the debate on State-sponsored
terrorism has been kept away from international
forums, including the United Nations. Beyond the
intelligence networks, the rest of the world knows
little about the behaviour of that aspect of terrorism
at national, regional and international levels. The
regional State sponsors of terror outfits exported to our
country have recently pursued new methods of denial
and belligerence by using reverse psychology and
attempting to distort narratives. Irrefutable evidence
of complicity in facilitating safe havens and logistical
support to terrorists has been responded to by failed
methods of counter-narratives, accusing Afghanistan
of ?€?providing safe havens to terrorists?€?. Exploiting the
democratic political dynamics of Afghanistan, they
attempt to sow discord among our people, victimize
our refugees by unfairly linking them to terrorism and
portray their orchestrated terror attacks as civil war."
63,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,62,,,,,,,,"Meanwhile, according to the latest United Nations
report, we have suffered more than 10,000 civilian
casualties yearly over the past four years, mainly due
to terrorist attacks plotted beyond our frontiers. In
their desperation, they do not even hold back from such
heavily risk-prone attempts as to abuse and manipulate
ironclad and all-weather friendships in international
relations, in favour of concealing the evidence of
their sponsorship of terrorism, obfuscating facts and
distorting narratives at regional and global forums."
64,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,63,,,,,,,,"In the light of increased terrorist activities around
the world, the time has come to openly debate the
regional State sponsorship of terror outfits exported"
65,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,64,,,,,,,,"to our country and let the world know more about its
behaviour. The Kabul Process is not just about outreach
to the Taliban; it is about ending the conflict, achieving
peace and preserving the democratic order, for which
numerous Afghans and allies have sacrificed their
lives. Moreover, the Taliban should not be permitted
to misuse the opportunity they have been presented, as
they have done in the past."
66,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,65,,,,,,,,"As we grapple with security challenges, we are
working to achieve the important objectives stipulated
in the agreement that founded the National Unity
Government of Afghanistan, witnessed and welcomed
by the international community. That is essential for
our national unity and political stability, as it is for the
success of our new peace plan. The effort is carried out
within the parameters of a broad-based dialogue with a
view to advancing the national interests of Afghanistan,
in conformity with the spirit of our Constitution. Our
overall objective is to advance national unity and
strengthen social cohesion and inclusivity to achieve
a just and peaceful society, fully grounded in the
rule of law, where our youth can fulfil their national
aspirations. We are confident that our efforts will soon
yield positive outcomes."
67,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,66,,,,,,,,"On today?€?s special occasion, I reaffirm the National
Unity Government?€?s commitment to empowering the
role of women in all facets of our society and politics.
Ms. Sarabi?€?s briefing offered a clear perspective on
progress made interms ofthe benchmarks of our national
strategy, resolution 1325 (2000) and the challenges ahead
of us. We now have female ministers, deputy ministers,
members of Parliament, peacemakers, civil society
activists and ambassadors serving as proactive agents
for the development of Afghanistan. Two weeks ago,
at a historic event, Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah
represented Afghanistan at the inaugural session of the
Human Rights Council in Geneva. That symbolized
Afghanistan?€?s overall commitment to the principles
of universal human rights. Despite progress, we know
that our achievements in the area of the promotion and
protection of human rights need to be consolidated as
indicated in the report of the Secretary-General with
regard to civilian casualties documented by the United
Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA),
which I mentioned earlier."
68,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,67,,,,,,,,"Against all odds, Afghanistan has progressed
steadily on the path of economic cooperation, increased
regional connectivity and shared prosperity. We have
expanded multidimensional relations with our Central"
69,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,68,,,,,,,,"Asian neighbours, thereby resulting in numerous
agreements in the areas of trade, connectivity
and economic cooperation. The inauguration
of Afghanistan?€?s segment of the Turkmenistan-
Afghanistan-Pakistan-India Pipeline in Herat by
President Ghani and leaders and senior officials of
Pakistan, Turkmenistan and India, following more
than a decade of preparatory work, has generated
new incentives for cooperation and opportunities for
fostering mutual trust and confidence. Additionally,
other regional projects aim to boost productivity
and economic cooperation for common gains. We
are looking forward to the forthcoming ministerial
conference on Afghanistan to be held in Tashkent."
70,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,69,,,,,,,,"We wish to expand relations with all partners,
including the United Nations. We are grateful for
the crucial assistance role of UNAMA, which has
been a catalyst for bringing change to the lives of
our people. We welcome the renewal of UNAMA?€?s
mandate through the adoption of resolution 2405
(2018) and underscore once again the imperative of
implementing the one United Nations approach for
achieving optimum efficiency and coherence. Let me
reconvey our appreciation for the dedicated efforts and
leadership of Special Representative of the Secretary-
General Yamamoto ?€? a dear friend."
71,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,70,,,,,,,,"Combating the illicit network of narcotics, money-
laundering, and terrorism finance remains a key
priority for us. Based on our national drug action plan,
we have continued eradication operations, and opiate
seizures have reached their highest levels since 2012.
We will continue to increase cooperation with our allies
to strengthen the relevant law enforcement agencies,
foster greater intelligence-sharing and set up effective
mechanisms to curtail drug trafficking."
72,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,71,,,,,,,,"Additionally, refugee repatriation from
neighbouring countries remains operational. We are
working in close collaboration with the Office of the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to
provide assistance and much needed services to that
vulnerable group. We call for continued international
support for the joint humanitarian response plan for the
period from 2018 to 2021, which requires $437 million
for 2018 to assist 2.8 million people in need. However,
security and durable peace are fundamental solutions
to addressing that humanitarian challenge, and
require comprehensive national, regional, and global
commitment and action."
73,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,72,,,,,,,,"Lastly, in two weeks?€?s time, 21 March will mark
the beginning of Nowruz ?€? the Afghan New Year.
We are beginning this new spring season with hope,
determination and confidence. As international pressure
to address the root causes of violence in our country
intensifies, our defence and security forces stand as
capable as ever to protect and defend Afghanistan
against international terrorism. Given that, we have
taken a historic step towards the restoration of durable
peace in our country. In that light, we look to our
international partners, including the Council, to remain
at our side in that endeavour."
74,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,73,,,,,,,,"The President: I shall now make a statement in my
capacity as Minister for Foreign Trade and Development
Cooperation of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.

We are discussing the situation in Afghanistan on
an important historic day. On this day 110 years ago,
15,000 female workers marched through the city of New
York demanding their rights. It is therefore a particular
honour for me to speak before the Security Council
today, which marks International Women?€?s Day."
75,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,74,,,,,,,,"For a long time, the Council has been attentive to
women and peace and security. On 31 October 2000,
the Council adopted resolution 1325 (2000) on that very
subject. The Netherlands was then, too, anon-permanent
member of the Council, and we contributed actively to
its adoption (see S/PV.4213). The resolution is a political
framework, thereby making clear that without women,
peace will not stand a chance or thrive. It is a also clear
acknowledgement of how women and girls often suffer
and are particularly vulnerable in times of war and
conflict, but it is also concerns their role, leadership
and responsibility in bringing about lasting peace."
76,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,75,,,,,,,,"Every country was encouraged to draw up a
national action plan. A minority of 73 countries has
done so, including, notably, Afghanistan with its very
active Afghan women leaders?€? network. Worldwide,
however, a great gap remains to bridge between the
norms established for women and the bitter reality
that women face, especially, but not only, in conflict
situations. There continues to be an overwhelming lack
of negotiations in which women play a meaningful part,
let alone a leadership role, but resolution 1325 (2000) is
not only about political participation or representation.
It is also about the protection of women and girls from
sexual and gender-based violence, especially in conflict
situations. That is the responsibility of us all ?€? not
only that of Member States, the United Nations and"
77,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,76,,,,,,,,"non-governmental organizations, but of citizens in
general. There should be no room for complacency, let
alone impunity. There must be zero tolerance in every
situation regardless of the circumstances."
78,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,77,,,,,,,,"For women in Afghanistan, there are also rays of
hope. In the days of Queen Soraya, in 1919, Afghan
women were allowed to vote significantly earlier than
in many other countries. In modern-day Afghanistan,
First Lady Rula Ghani successfully has advocated
for women?€?s rights. We hear of female judges and
women in Government as ministers, deputy ministers,
parliamentarians, and female police officers as was
mentioned earlier. From 2013 to 2017, the female
literacy rate nearly doubled. Statistics, however, also
show that much remains to be achieved, especially for
women and girls in rural areas."
79,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,78,,,,,,,,"The courageous filmmaker Roya Sadat sold her
wedding jewellery and an apartment to make a movie
that speaks to gender inequality and specifically brings
the issue of violence against women into the open,
which was a courageous decision. The brave women in
the film show us that with perseverance and will power
almost anything is possible. For many Afghan women,
however, their own situation remains too dire to
overcome by themselves. Facing violence, exclusion and
discrimination, they will continue to need our support
and helping hand in pursuit of needed assistance."
80,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,79,,,,,,,,"It is clear that many positive changes, some of which
were mentioned earlier this morning, have taken place
in Afghanistan since the fall of the Taliban regime. At
the same time, many of the reforms remain vulnerable,
occasionally fragile and by no means irreversible.
As we all know, Afghanistan continues to face many
problems, including high levels of violence, violent
attacks, poverty, corruption, discrimination and, above
all, the lack of opportunities for young people ?€? the
new generation. Therefore, as we have just renewed
UNAMA?€?s mandate through the unanimous adoption
of resolution 2405 (2018), I should like to offer a couple
of recommendations."
81,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,80,,,,,,,,"First, we can build peace only through inclusive
negotiations led by an inclusive Afghan Government.
The right instrument ?€? the Kabul Process ?€? is in
place. It is both Afghan-led and Afghan-owned, and it
is a peace and reconciliation mechanism. It deserves
our support. Last week?€?s gesture for peace made by
the Afghan Government at the second Kabul Process
conference was an important step in the right direction."
82,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,81,,,,,,,,"The message is clear. The Afghans are taking the lead,
and we will continue to support them. Afghanistan
needs a functioning security apparatus and a workable
and inclusive peace deal. That is no small task, and it
will require continued political courage, perseverance
and assistance."
83,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,82,,,,,,,,"Secondly, the international community should
focus its energy on supporting the peace talks. Clearly,
the solution has to be political. It will not be possible
without true commitment and constructive engagement
from all regional partners, and donor countries should
be expected to unify their efforts in this regard.
All too often, donors ?€? and here we have to look at
ourselves ?€? have parallel and sometimes conflicting
goals or objectives. Yet there is an obvious solution:
for the Afghan Government to set the priorities and
UNAMA to coordinate the One United Nations
response effectively, inclusively and efficiently."
84,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,83,,,,,,,,"Thirdly, for Afghanistan to emerge sustainably
from conflict, there is a need for a truly integrated
approach, one that strengthens coherence between all
sectors: political, security, development and human
rights, central to all endeavours. This requires creative
thinking, including in and by the United Nations
system, supported first and foremost by the Security
Council, but also the Member States. We should work
jointly in the prevention of conflict and in support of
durable peace and inclusive prosperity."
85,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,84,,,,,,,,"The Kingdom of the Netherlands will remain a
reliable and constructive partner for Afghanistan,
focused not only on the security sector but also more
broadly, and we have done so for 17 years. We strongly
support the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund,
and we will live up to our promise to allocate 50 per
cent of our support on budget, in close cooperation with
other partners.

Having said all this, I will now conclude. The
progress made in Afghanistan over the past 17
years is impressive. I commend the work of Special
Representative of the Secretary-General Yamamoto
and the outstanding efforts and hard work of his
team. I also very much welcome the decision of the
Secretary-General to host the ministerial conference
on Afghanistan in Geneva on 28 November. I am
confident that the Council will continue to support
Afghan-led efforts to achieve peace, bring about and
nurture stability, and reinforce inclusive, rights-based
development in Afghanistan, a process that should be"
86,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,85,,,,,,,,"aimed particularly at achieving all gender objectives
and goals.

I now resume my functions as President of
the Council."
87,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,86,,,,,,,,"I shall now give the floor to those members of the

Council who wish to make statements.

Ms. S??der (Sweden): Madam President, I wish
to thank you for having convened today?€?s briefing on
Afghanistan, with a necessary focus, on International
Women?€?s Day, on women and peace and security."
88,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,87,,,,,,,,"The correlation between gender equality and
peaceful societies is clear. Afghanistan will not achieve
the peace and development that its people so strongly
desire without unleashing and embracing the agency of
Afghan women."
89,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,88,,,,,,,,"I align myself with the statement to be made later
on behalf of the European Union and its member States.
I would also like to thank Special Representative
Yamamoto for his comprehensive briefing and to express
appreciation for the very important interventions by
Ms. Sarabi and Ms. Safi.

Sweden is a long-term donor to Afghanistan. We
were a participant in the Resolute Support Mission,
and we follow developments very closely. Today I will
dedicate my intervention to women?€?s issues. That does
not mean that the other aspects of the very difficult
situation in Afghanistan are forgotten."
90,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,89,,,,,,,,"While there have been genuine improvements in
women?€?s enjoyment of their human rights over the past
15 years, more is needed, as Afghan women continue to
seek to play their role in society. This is a particularly
critical moment for women?€?s participation in shaping
the future of Afghanistan."
91,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,90,,,,,,,,"As the country prepares for elections in 2018 and
2019, we expect the Government and the electoral
management bodies to take all steps necessary to
develop and implement gender-sensitive security and
election plans, so as to enable an environment in which
both women and men can safely run for elected office,
campaign freely and vote, not least in remote and
rural districts."
92,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,91,,,,,,,,"Let me commend the Government?€?s continued
efforts to realize its vision for peace. This is essential
given that, as we have heard, violence by terrorist
groups must be stopped, and the solution to the conflict
can only be political. We commend the hosting of the"
93,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,92,,,,,,,,"second meeting of the Kabul Process last week. During
the meeting, the Government presented a constructive
road map for peace. We call on the Taliban to engage
in a dialogue on the road map. In order to ensure the
legitimacy of the peace process, it must be inclusive
and uphold all of the achievements made over the past
decades. Regional actors are expected to make their
contribution to the peace endeavours. This is decisive
in the fight against terrorism and in breaking the
vicious circle."
94,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,93,,,,,,,,"In each of our Council meetings, we must reflect
on how the women and peace and security agenda
translates into real change. We must build on the
knowledge that the slogan ?€?more women, more peace?€?
is certainly true. On the basis of the principles of our
feminist foreign policy, we want to highlight the ?€?four
R?€?s?€?: rights, representation, resources and a reality
check. I would like to briefly highlight four areas in
which increased efforts could make a real difference
for Afghan women."
95,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,94,,,,,,,,"First, it is about safe access to health care
and education.

Secondly, it is about investing in women, not least
in the national action plan on women and peace and
security, in accordance with resolution 1325 (2000)."
96,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,95,,,,,,,,"Thirdly, violence against Afghan women and girls
is a grave violation of their human rights and must
be ended. In this regard, Sweden supports Women
for Afghan Women, which works to fight gender-
based violence with shelters, family counselling
and mediation.

Fourthly, women should be present across the whole
of Afghan society. We are encouraged by the improved
gender equality in business, civil society, the civil
service, the judiciary, the police and the army. Women
should never have to fear making their contribution
to society."
97,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,96,,,,,,,,"Today?€?s briefers, Ms. Sarabi and Ms. Safi, have
devoted much of their professional lives to women?€?s
participation. They have demonstrated that Afghanistan
does not lack strong female leaders; yet they are not
often enough at the table when decisions about peace
and security are being made. Sweden will continue
our dialogue and mediation training of local female
actors to build their capacity to lead in local peace and
reconciliation efforts."
98,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,97,,,,,,,,"Let me commend the Kingdom of the Netherlands,
as penholder, on today?€?s adoption of resolution 2405
(2018) and for the constructive manner in which
it conducted the negotiations. The United Nations
Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) plays
a critical role in support of national efforts towards a
comprehensive and inclusive Afghan-led and Afghan-
owned peace process. This is also true of women?€?s
roles and for the national action plan on resolution 1325
(2000)."
99,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,98,,,,,,,,"The Council now need to back up and support
UNAMA as it carries out its work at this critical time.
The renewed mandate must now also be backed up with
adequate and sustainable resources in order for the
Mission to fulfil its mandate.

After years of conflict and violence, Afghanistan
has reached yet another milestone. Elections are around
the corner, and the outlines of a path to peace are on
the table."
100,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,99,,,,,,,,"The potential for peace must be fully realized with
the meaningful participation of Afghan women.

Ms. Andreyeva (United Kingdom): I would like
to pay tribute to my Dutch colleagues for their tireless
efforts to reach a consensus on the important resolution
2405 (2018), adopted today. I would also like to thank
all of our briefers and the Special Representative of
the Secretary-General, Ambassador Yamamoto, for his
briefing and for his and his team?€?s continued efforts in
challenging circumstances."
101,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,100,,,,,,,,"I am delighted to share the Chamber with so many
women on International Women?€?s Day. I am especially
pleased that we are discussing Afghanistan today, as I
had the privilege to spend several years in Afghanistan
working to support education for Afghan girls and a
future in Parliament for Afghan women. As Ms. Safi
and Ms. Sarabi have demonstrated in their briefings
and their own impressive work, women have a vital role
to play in securing Afghanistan?€?s future, and we should
all stand beside them. Afghanistan cannot find lasting
peace with only half its population. The United Nations
must maintain a strong role in promoting and protecting
the rights of women across Afghanistan and continue
to support the Afghan Government in implementing its
national action plan on women and peace and security."
102,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,101,,,,,,,,"Ensuring accountability and equal access to justice
for all are essential to long-term peace and stability.
We welcome the adoption of Afghanistan?€?s revised"

the Government of Afghanistan to ensure its full
implementation in line with the law on the elimination
of violence against women, which we hope will continue
to be used to guarantee Afghan women the protection
and accountability they deserve."
104,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,103,,,,,,,,"The United Nations Assistance Mission in
Afghanistan (UNAMA) is an essential mechanism
in supporting Afghanistan?€?s recovery from conflict.
The continued presence of UNAMA and the resolve,
resourcefulness and skill with which its staff support the
Afghan people are a strong signal of the international
community?€?s commitment."
105,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,104,,,,,,,,"The United Kingdom welcomes the Secretary-
General?€?s decision to host a ministerial conference on
Afghanistan in Geneva on 28 November. Implementing
the findings of the strategic review and the Secretary-
General?€?s report of August 2017 (S/2017/696) will allow
UNAMA to be as efficient as possible and to adapt as
circumstances change. I am pleased to see that this is
reflected in resolution 2405 (2018), adopted today, and
I hope it will send a strong signal to the Mission?€?s hard-
working personnel that we fully support them."
106,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,105,,,,,,,,"UNAMA?€?s mandate to support peace and
reconciliation in Afghanistan remains at the core of
the Mission. That will be delivered sustainably only
through a credible, inclusive, Afghan-led and Afghan-
owned political process where all Afghan citizens,
whatever their background, can resolve grievances
through dialogue. Of course, for peace to be sustainable
it must be inclusive. The sharp focus on the involvement
of women in peace and security in this mandate renewal
is particularly welcome."
107,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,106,,,,,,,,"With inclusiveness in mind, we highly commend
the bold offer laid out by President Ghani, Chief
Executive Abdullah and Afghanistan?€?s National Unity
Government at the recent meeting of the Kabul Process
for Peace and Security Cooperation. We welcome the
credibility, flexibility and openness of the offer, which
gives the Taliban the opportunity to be part of a political
process towards peace. While the Council was not able
to reflect those recent developments in the mandate
renewal, I hope we will find another opportunity to
endorse it and to lend our full support to those Afghan-
led efforts."
108,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,107,,,,,,,,"Finally, the United Nations must play a strong role
in supporting free and fair elections. Elections, both
this year and next, are an opportunity for the nation

to communicate its aspirations to the political parties.
Those elections are a crucial point at which political
trust can be renewed and stability forged. We commend
the progress made by Afghanistan?€?s Independent
Electoral Commission towards electoral reform and we
encourage it to redouble its efforts to ensure that voter
registration is completed according to agreed timelines.
We hope that UNAMA will support those efforts fully."
109,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,108,,,,,,,,"In conclusion, we fully support UNAMA, and
we welcome the renewal of its mandate today. As a
Council, we have collectively endorsed the importance
of inclusion, including of women, and of upholding
and promoting human rights. We call on all parties
to engage meaningfully in a political process to bring
lasting peace and stability to the people of Afghanistan.

Mr. Ma Zhaoxu (China) (spoke in Chinese): Iwould
like to welcome you to New York, Madam President,
and thank you for presiding over today?€?s open debate."
110,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,109,,,,,,,,"Today marks International Women?€?s Day. At the
outset, I would like to extend to you, Madam President,
and the other female colleagues present my greetings
for the holiday. On this special occasion, we must
remember the female Blue Helmets who are serving
the peacekeeping cause. As the Council knows, when
Chinese people strive for a better life, women hold
up half of the sky. Chinese women are contributing
to world peace. At this very moment, in Juba, South
Sudan, 14 female peacekeepers are working hard
in the infantry, under the leadership of their team
leader, to help women and children. I would like to

women and peace and security agenda. It promotes
the protection of women in situations of conflict and

would like to acknowledge its efforts in support of
Afghan women. Similarly, we would like to recognize

the rule of law and due process all terrorist acts and"

challenges to its security, stability and development.
Its people continue to pay a heavy price because of
the instability and violence affecting the country. As
the report of the Secretary-General highlights, it is
particularly women and children who constitute the
most vulnerable segments of the society."
127,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,126,,,,,,,,"We take note of the efforts being exerted by the
Government to improve the plight of Afghan women,
including by implementing the law on the elimination
of violence against women, as well as upholding
resolution 1325 (2000), on women and peace and
security. As highlighted in the report of the Secretary-
General, we believe the implementation of the national
action plan on women and peace and security will
go a long way in promoting the full and effective
participation of Afghan women in the country?€?s peace
and reconciliation endeavours."

our sympathy and solidarity with the people and the
Government of Afghanistan following the loss of

be held to account."
129,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,128,,,,,,,,"No doubt, the long-term security and stability
of Afghanistan can be ensured only through a
comprehensive and inclusive Afghan-led and
Afghan-owned reconciliation and political process.
In that regard, the renewed call made by the Afghan
Government for unconditional peace talks with the
Taliban and the outlining of a framework for peace
presented at the second conference of the Kabul Process
are encouraging. We fully support the Afghan-led and
Afghan-owned peace and reconciliation process and
appreciate the Government?€?s offer for peace with the
Taliban. We hope the Taliban will respond positively to
that call and engage in direct talks with the Government
with a view to achieving a political settlement and
restoring lasting peace and security in Afghanistan.
The support of regional and international stakeholders
is key to the success of the peace process. We welcome
the declaration adopted on 28 February, which reiterates
the support of the international community to the Kabul
Process for an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned peace and
reconciliation process and reaffirms the commitment to"
130,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,129,,,,,,,,"the necessary fight against terrorism in order to bring
about lasting peace, security, stability and prosperity
to Afghanistan.

With regard to the political situation in the country,
the tension between the Presidential Palace and
Jamiat-e-Islami is a matter of concern, which could
potentially undermine the National Unity Government
and upset the already fragile political arrangement,
as the report of the Secretary-General notes. We hope
that the parties will resolve the dispute peacefully
and expeditiously and redirect their efforts towards
addressing the multiple challenges facing Afghanistan."
131,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,130,,,,,,,,"The holding of peaceful and democratic
parliamentary and district council elections within the
set time frame is indeed very important, and we note
that some progress has been made in preparation for
the elections. Accelerating such efforts and building
the confidence of the Afghan people in the electoral
process through the involvement and participation of
all the relevant stakeholders will be key to ensuring the
timely and successful holding of the elections."
132,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,131,,,,,,,,"Without sustained and inclusive economic growth
and development, the peace and security challenges
faced by Afghanistan cannot be effectively addressed.
That is why the Unity Government needs the coordinated
and comprehensive support of the international
community to advance its political reform and national
development priorities, as envisaged in the Afghanistan
National Peace and Development Framework. It is vital
that the international community sustain its engagement
and deliver on its various commitments in that regard."
133,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,132,,,,,,,,"Given all the points I mentioned, the efforts of
UNAMA in promoting and in supporting the initiatives
for peace talks, reconciliation, dialogue and support
for social and economic development, with full respect
for the country?€?s sovereignty and leadership, remain
very important. We therefore welcome the unanimous
adoption of resolution 2405 (2018), which renews the
mandate of UNAMA for another year."
134,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,133,,,,,,,,"Ms. Wronecka (Poland): Allow me to start by
thanking you, Madam President, for presiding over
today?€?s meeting. We greatly appreciate it. I would also
like to commend the Kingdom of the Netherlands for
its efforts as penholder in today?€?s adoption of resolution
2405 (2018). I appreciate the presence of our briefers:
Special Representative Yamamoto, Ms. Sarabi and
Ms. Safi. Their briefings described many positive"
135,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,134,,,,,,,,"developments, and we should continue along those
lines. Allow me to share some of Poland?€?s thoughts.

Poland strongly supports the fundamental role of
the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan
(UNAMA) and its personnel in supporting Afghan
society, promoting and monitoring human rights,
encouraging peace and reconciliation and providing
valuable assistance to the Government of Afghanistan.
I would like to align myself with the statement of the
European Union (EU), to be delivered later."
136,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,135,,,,,,,,"We welcome the Kabul Process on peace and
security cooperation as a prospective framework,
bringing together a number of regional and international
participants, including the United Nations and the EU.
We believe that the initiative will give new impetus to
the efforts and lead to a peaceful and prompt settlement
of the conflict. In that context, following consultation,
of course, with the female members of the High Peace
Council, we call on the Afghan Government to put in
place clear procedures for how to engage and to include
women in peace negotiations with the Taliban and other
parties to the conflict."
137,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,136,,,,,,,,"The fight against the Taliban greatly affects women,
since they make up 12 per cent of the conflict-related
civilian casualties. Consequently, it is women?€?s rights
that are violated the most by the presence of the Taliban
in communities. At the same time, women frequently
have better access to certain populations and locations
and can gather critical information about threats to
security. They can also improve the relationship of the
security forces with local communities and can detect
early signs of radicalization, since they are often the first
targets of fundamentalists. However, Afghan women
do not have a significant role in decision-making,
including on how to combat the Taliban at the local
and national levels. We appreciate the fact that the
percentage of women in the High Peace Council has
increased to 20 per cent, including at a senior level
and in the provincial peace committees across the 34
provinces of Afghanistan. However, women?€?s voices
are missing in the actual talks and negotiations."
138,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,137,,,,,,,,"While we recognize the Afghan Government?€?s
efforts to strengthen the engagement of women in the
police and security sectors, many challenges remain
in that area. Further work is needed to develop clear
procedures on how to increase the number of women
in the leadership and management of the security
sector. The process cannot happen without the active"
139,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,138,,,,,,,,"participation of civil society organizations led by
women. In that connection, we recognize the important
role played by the United Nations Entity for Gender
Equality and the Empowerment of Women and other
United Nations entities in supporting the empowerment
of Afghan women. Moreover, we would like to take
this opportunity to highlight the positive impact and
ongoing significance of the international commitments
made at the NATO Warsaw Summit in 2016 and its
important influence on security, development and
stability in Afghanistan.

The protection of civilians and compliance with the
obligations under international humanitarian law remain
a serious problem, causing innocent people to suffer the
effects of the military conflict in Afghanistan. As the
2017 annual report on the issue showed, there is still
significant room for progress. Poland strongly supports
the efforts of UNAMA to limit civilian casualties, in
particular among children, who are severely affected by
unexploded ordnance."
140,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,139,,,,,,,,"The upcoming parliamentary and_ district
council elections represent a significant task for the
Afghan political system on its path to an inclusive
and transparent outcome. Poland hopes that the new
Parliament will create a strong legislative foundation
for the sustainable development of the country. In terms
of technical support, we encourage UNAMA to provide
the necessary assistance at the request of the Afghan
authorities. The broad participation of women, both as
candidates and as voters, remains a high priority for us.

In conclusion, I would like once again to commend
the work of UNAMA, and in particular Mr. Yamamoto."

the establishment of a genuine inclusive peace process."
146,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,145,,,,,,,,"We should also like to see an assessment of the
progress made in the area of peace and joint measures to
combat terrorism in Afghanistan and the region. In that

engage in an open dialogue, based on the achievements
of the 2004 Constitution, including respect for the rights
of citizens, especially those of women. Notwithstanding
the sense of hope emanating from the second meeting
of the Kabul Process, my delegation remains concerned
by the persistence of some political tensions in the

difficult socio-political context, in which the debate on
the place of women in society remains a particularly

means to consolidate their place in society and promote
their participation in regional and_ international
initiatives for peace, while strengthening the protection"

Ms. Tachco (United States of America): I thank

importance of including women in Afghanistan?€?s

leaders for taking a courageous stance at the Kabul

Process conference last week. They reaffirmed their
clear commitment to peace and their willingness to
engage. The onus is now on the Taliban to return that
commitment and to demonstrate that it is ready to talk.
The message in Kabul was clear. The door to peace is
open; the Taliban must choose to walk through that
door. The United States position, as outlined in our
South Asia strategy, is unambiguous ?€? the only way
to end the conflict is through a negotiated settlement.
We reaffirm our commitment to supporting direct
negotiations between the Afghan Government and
the Taliban."
152,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,151,,,,,,,,"The Afghan people today are ready for peace.
They understand that a peace agreement will require
compromise on both sides, but they will not sacrifice
their safety, legal protections or human rights to achieve
peace. They will not return to the oppression and
isolation of the late 1990s. The Taliban has an obligation
to explain how it fits into the rapidly advancing Afghan
society, where Afghan men and women are free to
speak their minds, choose their leaders and help
shape Government reforms. Groups and countries that
provide the Taliban and another armed insurgents with
weapons, money or political support are only fuelling
the conflict and the environment that allows terrorism
to persist and grow. We cannot be successful if the
status quo is allowed to continue. We renew our call on
Afghanistan?€?s neighbours to join our efforts to bring a
resolution to the conflict."
153,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,152,,,,,,,,"In addition to the contribution of the Kabul
Process to achieving peace at the national level, it is
also critically important that we continue to support
the role of civil society in building and strengthening
consensus for the peace process across all elements of
Afghan society. International Women?€?s Day provides
us with a welcome occasion to emphasize those efforts.
Ms. Sarabi?€?s initiative with Afghanistan?€?s re-energized

because we continue to see appalling statistics of
civilian deaths and wounded in 2017 and in 2018 thus
far. We are troubled that the rate at which women are
killed or injured is on the rise and that grave injuries
are inflicted on civilians by constant suicide bombs
attacks and other attacks with improvised explosive
devices, which disproportionately affect women, boys
and girls. Attacks on public places, as we witnessed
in the attacks carried out in January, are particularly
unsettling. As such, we call on all parties to the conflict

international humanitarian law and the basic norms of
human rights."

Bonn and Tokyo Conferences in order to strengthen
governance and the rule of law, among other things.
The resolution also urges UNAMA to collaborate in
the implementation of the constitutional provisions and
international treaties on the full enjoyment of the rights
of women, including the Convention on the Elimination
of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, as
well as to support Government efforts to ensuring an
inclusive electoral process, including measures to allow
the full and safe participation of women."
165,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,164,,,,,,,,"While the proportion of women on the High Peace
Council rose from 9 to 20 per cent, including at its
highest levels, it is also true and regrettable that in
real conversations, including during the Kabul Process
last year and in talks in Muscat, no women attended.
As a result, our delegation urges the Government of
Afghanistan to ensure that in upcoming dialogues and
conversations on peace and security, women participate
actively and that they be optimally represented in all
State institutions and have a significant role in political
decision-making ?€? as is the case in the policies of
the President of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea,
Mr. Obiang Nguema Mbasogo."
166,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,165,,,,,,,,"In conclusion, I would like to stress that we must
all take advantage of the opportunities we have before
us in all contexts to add our grain of sand in order to
transform the lives of women wherever they are. Now is
the crucial moment to seek gender equality in the 2030
Agenda for Sustainable Development, to transform
the lives of Afghan women in all of its dimensions
and manifestations. That is why our delegation calls
upon the Government of Afghanistan and UNAMA to
continue its work and to actively follow up to ensure the
effective implementation of the national action plan on
women, peace and security through the establishment,
in due course, of strategies and mechanisms to finance
the plan?€?s budget."

Day, Madam President, and we congratulate you and all
the women of the world on this holiday. We remember
your Permanent Representative?€?s appeal for seeing as
many women as possible at today?€?s meeting, and we can
see evidence of that in this Chamber. The absence of
women in my delegation in no way signifies disrespect,
let alone dislike. In Russia 8 March is an official
holiday. Today all our women have the day off, and we
are working for them."
169,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,168,,,,,,,,"We would like to thank Mr. Yamamoto for his
thorough report on the current state of affairs in
Afghanistan and Ms. Sarabi and Ms. Safi for their
interesting briefings. For our part, we would like to
make the following comments."
170,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,169,,,,,,,,"We are still very concerned about the security
situation in Afghanistan. The Security Council?€?s
mission to Kabul confirmed the fact that the situation
on that front continues to be very difficult. Towards the
end of January, unfortunately, the country was rocked
by a series of bloody terrorist attacks that took the
lives of around 200 Afghan civilians and injured more
than 400. The various terrorist organizations have not
slowed down. Their terrorist activity continues, they
are mounting systematic attacks in various parts of the
country and they have maintained full or partial control
of a significant percentage of its territory."
171,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,170,,,,,,,,"One of the serious factors in the deterioration
of the situation is the activity of the Islamic State in
Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). Jihadists are consistently
adding to the numbers of militants in the north of
Afghanistan, turning the region into a springboard
for further expansion, including into Central Asia.
One particularly alarming phenomenon is_ ISIL?€?s
establishment in Afghanistan of an impressive network
of militant training camps, whose trainees include
citizens of Central Asian States and Russia. It is
regrettable that there has still been no investigation
of the fact that unmarked helicopters are transporting
ISIL members and supplying them with weapons in the
north of Afghanistan. This problem cannot be ignored.
The situation should be thoroughly investigated and
this practice ended immediately. Clearing the country?€?s
northern regions of terrorist elements will need far
more decisive measures."
172,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,171,,,,,,,,"We supported resolution 2405 (2018), proposed
by the Netherlands, on extending the mandate of the
United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan
(UNAMA), taking into account the importance of the
United Nations presence there. The Mission does a great
deal for the country, but it is by definition incapable
of being a panacea for all of Afghanistan?€?s problems.
We hope the resolution will improve its effectiveness.
It is nonetheless regrettable that during the agreement
on the text a number of the Russian delegation?€?s key
concerns were ignored, particularly those relating to
ISIL?€?s strengthening of its positions in Afghanistan,
which I just mentioned. As experience has shown,
attempts to minimize the scale of these problems can
have disastrous consequences."
173,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,172,,,,,,,,"The terrorist threat and the narcotics problem
are inextricably linked. Drugs represent a significant
financial source for Afghan terrorists. According to the
Afghanistan Opium Survey 2017 of the United Nations
Office on Drugs and Crime, last year there was a
significant increase ?€? more than 60 per cent ?€? in the
area under drug cultivation in Afghanistan, and opium
production increased by more than 80 per cent, reaching
a record level, including in the northern provinces.
The drug trade also continues to be a serious problem
in Afghanistan itself and in its neighbours. We urge
the military presences there to give greater attention
to this issue, including by cooperating with regional
organizations such as the Collective Security Treaty
Organization (CSTO) and the Shanghai Cooperation
Organization (SCO). We should remember that the
Kanal operation, conducted under the auspices of the
CSTO, has been blocking Afghan drug-smuggling
routes since 2003, and thanks to it, hundreds of tons
of illegally trafficked drugs and thousands of firearms
have been seized. Law-enforcement agencies from more
than 20 states and many international organizations
worked together to make it happen."
174,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,173,,,,,,,,"The fact unfortunately remains that the prolonged,
large-scale presence of foreign contingents in
Afghanistan has not led to an improvement in
the military and political situation. Moreover, the
expansion of the authority of foreign military personnel
has brought an increase in civilian casualties, and there
is data on this in United Nations reports. We believe
that putting the emphasis on force alone is a mistake.
We see no alternatives to a political process aimed at
achieving sustainable national reconciliation, and if that
process is going to be effective, it should be inclusive."
175,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,174,,,,,,,,"Attempts to marginalize specific countries in the
region are counterproductive. The outside stakeholders
should encourage a culture of good neighbourliness and
cooperation, and an understanding of the importance of
the regional dimension of the Afghan settlement."
176,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,175,,,,,,,,"We believe firmly that the key to stabilization in
Afghanistan resides in negotiation efforts that can
pave the way for the launch of a national reconciliation
process, led by the Afghans themselves, as soon as
possible, and we are ready to assist with this. The
principle of honest and equal partnership, taking the
interests of all regional stakeholders into account,
which serves as a basis for the Moscow format and
the mechanism of the resumed SCO-Afghanistan
Contact Group, is optimal for launching the negotiation
process. We support Uzbekistan?€?s initiative to hold a
ministerial conference on the Afghanistan settlement in
Tashkent on 26 and 27 March. We view it as part of the
development of the Moscow format and the activities
of the SCO-Afghanistan Contact Group. We note the
results of the second meeting of the Kabul Process on
28 February and the call to the Taliban by President
Ghani of Afghanistan to begin a dialogue. We hope that
the political appeals will be followed by practical steps
to achieve that."
177,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,176,,,,,,,,"Afghanistan is on the threshold of a new election
cycle. We support ensuring that parliamentary and
presidential elections, which should be a powerful
unifying factor for the Afghan people, are held on time.
In order to do that, all of Afghanistan?€?s political forces
should hew to a balanced line that avoids polarizing
society and infringing on national minority rights.
Resolving the Afghan conflict, as with crisis situations
in other parts of the world, requires that the key players
ensure that their efforts genuinely intersect, and we are
ready for that collaboration."

179,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,178,,,,,,,,"Sarabi, Deputy Chairperson of the High Peace Council
and Ms. Mariam Safi, Executive Director of the
Organization for Policy Research and Development
Studies, for their briefings.

Itis an honour for me to be able to represent Bolivian
women today. The women in my country are a symbol
of determination and strength, which are qualities that
have long gone unnoticed. Let us remember that today
is not a day of festivities, but one that commemorates
the struggle for women?€?s?€? rights. Bolivia pays tribute
to those women for all their fortitude, in particular for
moving forward in conflict situations as in the case of
the women of Afghanistan. We should recognize all
their work not only today ?€? on International Women?€?s
Day. That recognition should always be conveyed, but
not just in speeches, but also in the form of concrete
actions that empower women. That is the best way to
honour them."
180,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,179,,,,,,,,"The role of women is a priority component in
the development and unity of Afghan society. The
involvement of women in the current process is
particularly relevant owing to the fact that they are
often the ones primarily responsible for their families
while seeking to ensure their well-being. Now,
however, they are taking on leadership roles in seeking
peace in Afghanistan. Our inclusion in all areas is not
only required to bring about sustainable development,
but also to bring about the peace and security for
which we strive so mightily in the Security Council,
the Organization and throughout the world. As the
Deputy Chairperson of Afghanistan?€?s High Peace
Council put it, ?€?peace without women?€?s meaningful
participation is impossible?€?."
181,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,180,,,,,,,,"Bolivia wishes once again to underscore the mission
undertaken by the Security Council to Kabul in January,
during which we were able to witness the people work
to rebuild their country. That visit reaffirmed our
commitment to the United Nations Assistance Mission
in Afghanistan, as well as to carrying out joint activities
aimed at the implementation of the United Nations
Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy so as to prevent
violent extremism. Nevertheless, we must express our
deep concern about the increase in violent incidents
that began this year owing to the various attacks against
civilians, nearly one third of whom were children. It is
essential that the negotiations move forward to avoid
any further undermining of a peaceful settlement in
the region."
182,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,181,,,,,,,,"As clearly stated in the report of the Secretary-
General (S/2018/165), the political volatility has been
exacerbated and created a sense of insecurity in the
community, particularly among the residents of Kabul,
who were targeted by a wave of suicide attacks in
January. The potential threat to the security and stability
of Afghanistan will continue so long as the threat of
terrorist organizations, such as the Islamic State in
Iraq and the Levant-Khorsan Province ?€? which was
responsible for several other attacks not only in Kabul,
but also in the eastern province of Nangarhar ?€? maintain
their presence in Khorsan province and continue to
resist the efforts by Afghan and international armed
forces. Bolivia expresses its condemnation in the
strongest terms of all terrorist acts, regardless of the
group or entity that seeks to impose its ideology."
183,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,182,,,,,,,,"We also express our concern about the prolonged
stalemate in the political dialogue between the
National Unity Government of Afghanistan and the
Jamiat-e-Islami political party. We believe that the
time is ripe for the parties concerned to take proactive
steps and move forward in view of the holding of
the 2018 elections. We encourage the efforts by the
Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan
together with its Central Asian neighbours to promote
mechanisms and platforms for regional, interregional
and international cooperation to achieve peace,
stability and long-term sustainable development, as
well as actions to promote connectivity linking trade
policies, finance, infrastructure improvement and trade
among Afghanistan, Central Asian countries and other
regions. We hope that the instability that Afghanistan
is experiencing will shed its fragility so as to provide
the stable environment needed for the holding of
transparent and inclusive elections in the near future."
184,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,183,,,,,,,,"The fact that over the past several months many
families have been displaced without any immediate
prospect of returning to their homes in a safe and
dignified manner remains an issue that the Security
Council must continue to prioritize. In that regard,
we call on the countries of the region to step up their
commitment to share information and documentation
that will ensure those people?€?s voluntary, informed,
dignified, safe and permanent return to their places
of origin, and, at all costs, safeguard against a
repetition of circumstances leading to their return to
insecurity or areas that are inappropriate for them.
Accordingly, Bolivia believes that the success of
subregional, regional, interregional, and international"

unequivocal respect for increasing the representation
of women at all decision-making levels in national,

conflict pursuant to resolution 1325 (2000)."
186,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,185,,,,,,,,"Lastly, we urge against any military solution to
the situation in Afghanistan, and we join any initiative
that promotes inclusive dialogue that is predicated on
respect for sovereignty, independence and territorial
integrity of other countries. We therefore state our
full support for the Kabul Process, which, under the
leadership of the Government of Afghanistan, seeks
to achieve peace, security and sustainability in the
country for the benefit all Afghans."

participating at an increasing level in social spheres
of every day life. We take note of the importance of a
comprehensive analysis of today?€?s topic as seen from
a female perspective, as has been proposed by the
presidency of the Kingdom of the Netherlands."
190,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,189,,,,,,,,"Kazakhstan commends the actions taken by the
Government of Afghanistan, namely, seeking gender
equality within public services; the adoption of a
national plan of action, which will include developing
a policy for the protection of women during crises; and
the establishment of special courts to combat violence
directed against women, as well as the adoption of a law
on eliminating violence against women and espousing
resolution 1325 (2000), on women and peace and

for his statement."
191,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,190,,,,,,,,"As everyone knows, this coming fall Kazakhstan
will hold a conference on the expansion of women?€?s

rights in Afghanistan, which will cover the relevant
socioeconomic and political areas in the country;
sharing lessons learned in the area of establishing
gender equality; and implementing recommendations
concerning the expansion of women?€?s rights in the
country. I would like to inform the Council that
Kazakhstan has taken the initiative of continuing
co-financing the education programme for Afghan
citizens, together with the European Union and other
partners. Within the framework of that education
programme, which has raised $50 million, nearly 1,000
Afghan citizens will have pursued their education
in Kazakh universities during the period from 2010
to 2021. Currently the European Union is preparing
financing for the first part of a related project, which
will be implemented together with UN-Women. Its goal
will be to provide education for female Afghan students
in Kazakhstan."
192,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,191,,,,,,,,"We are very concerned by violence against women
in Afghanistan as well as by the growing number of
deaths due to terrorist attacks and massive air strikes
conducted by the army. As indicated in the report of the
Secretary-General (S/2018/165), women accounted for
some 12 per cent of the overall number of victims."
193,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,192,,,,,,,,"We support effective formats of regional and
global cooperation as well as United Nations efforts in
Afghanistan. We welcome the solutions that have been
developed by UNAMA that are aimed at reducing the
number of victims among civilians, improving their
standard of living and developing the educational and
medical fields. We call on all countries concerned to take
part in implementing the relevant recommendations.

I should like to specify that thanks to the initiative
of Kazakhstan during its presidency of the Council,
a visit to Afghanistan was organized for members of
the Council during which meetings were held with
representatives of the Afghan Parliament and women?€?s
organizations, chaired by the First Lady, Rula Ghani.
We should not forget that the number of terrorist attacks
continues to grow, as shown by the attacks that took
place in January and Kabul and Jalalabad, carried out
by the Taliban and Da?€?esh."
194,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,193,,,,,,,,"We welcome the second Kabul Process, in which
the Kazakh delegation participated. We believe that
we should very carefully study the idea of beginning
peace negotiations with the Taliban, as proposed by His
Excellency President Ghani. It is vital to consider the
following aspects in these negotiations: acknowledge"
195,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,194,,,,,,,,"the Taliban as a political party, impose a ceasefire,
implement transitional confidence-building measures
that will pave the way towards elections; revise the
Constitution or introduce amendments  thereinto;
address grievances and apply the law; and release certain
Taliban members from prison and remove some from
United Nations sanctions lists. Political and economic
problems as well as the security threats that Afghan is
confronting requires the constant support of countries
of the region, the international community, the United
Nations and especially of the Security Council."
196,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,195,,,,,,,,"Kazakhstan continues to promote a model of
sustainable development made up of three pillars.

First, concerning the link between security and
development, we are convinced that to achieve lasting
peace and security in the country, it is essential to
implement development programmes."
197,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,196,,,,,,,,"The second pillar is a regional approach. In the
context of the growing globalization of conflicts, this
new approach will make it possible to confront cross-
border challenges and threats, because it is impossible
today to find solutions to these problems solely within
the borders of one State. Proof of that was the launch
on 23 February in Herat of two major transnational
projects, the Turkmenistan-A fghanistan-Pakistan-India
Pipeline and the tripartite Turkmenistan-A fghanistan-
Pakistan 500-kV power project, as well as the laying
of fibre-optic cables and the building of a rail link
between Mazar-e-Sharif and Herat."
198,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,197,,,,,,,,"The third major pillar is the principle of One
United Nations. The growing number of conflicts and
contemporary challenges requires greater coordination
and efficiency in the work of the United Nations, both
at Headquarters and at the regional level, especially
in view of the cuts to the budget of the Organization.
Without such coordination we would see a fragmentation
of programmes and projects, which could be avoided
by combining the efforts of the various structures and
bodies of the global Organization in order to achieve
sustainable development in a holistic manner rather
than in a piecemeal way, focused on a specific region."

Kazakh proverb: ?€?A woman rocks the cradle with one
hand while running the world with the other?€?."

as well as the sincere efforts and dedication of United

of Afghanistan in these difficult circumstances. We
welcome the adoption today of resolution 2405 (2018),
extending the mandate of UNAMA."
203,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,202,,,,,,,,"Over the past four centuries, Afghanistan has
suffered from political and security instability that has
negatively affected the lives of the people. The critical
political conditions in Afghanistan require all those
who are wise and all the heads of political parties to
give priority to national interests over partisan ones in
order to provide the Afghan people with a decent life
after years of war and conflict. We in the Council must
continue to step upp our efforts to support the political
process and to encourage the timely holding of the
parliamentary and presidential elections. I would like
to address the following points."
204,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,203,,,,,,,,"First, concerning the political situation, we
welcome the efforts of the Independent Election
Commission and the progress made towards the
holding of the parliamentary elections next July,
despite the recent domestic unrest in Afghanistan. The
Commission has continued with its work and appointed
a new management structure. It has prepared the voter
registry and linked it to the polling stations. It has also
approved national identification cards ?€? tazkiras ?€? as
part of the voter-registration process. We hope that
these preparations will lead to broad participation on
the part of the Afghan people. There is also a need to
focus on encouraging women to actively participate in
the upcoming elections."
205,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,204,,,,,,,,"As the parliamentary elections draw near, we note
with regret the increasing political tensions among the
various political parties and coalitions in Afghanistan.
This puts more pressure on the National Unity
Government and has led to delays in the implementation
of the national reform agenda.

Secondly, concerning the security situation, the
State of Kuwait supports the call of the Secretary-"
206,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,205,,,,,,,,"General to lower the level of threat in Afghanistan
and Central Asia. However, the security situation in
Afghanistan is unstable. Conflict continues between
the Government of Afghanistan and opposition forces
in most of the country. The United Nations recorded
23,744 security incidents in Afghanistan in 2017, 63 per
cent of which were due to armed conflict in Afghanistan.
Suicide attacks have increased by 50 per cent compared
to 2016. Those figures underscore the fact that the
Afghani Government and the international community
are facing a very daunting task. The Taliban and
Da?€?esh continue to launch terrorist attacks against
unarmed civilians. We are all aware that those attacks
have caused many civilian casualties. Last year alone,
UNAMA recorded 10,453 civilians killed or injured
in violent acts, in addition to damaging homes and
property and the displacement of families."
207,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,206,,,,,,,,"Third is the issue of human rights. When we speak
about human rights we should recall the fact that today?€?s
meeting coincides with the International Women?€?s Day.
Women, and mothers in particular, make up half of
the society and contribute significantly to raising new
generations that can shoulder their responsibilities. We
believe in the great role of women in our societies. They
must be guaranteed all their political and civil rights.
That is a basic demand all over the world, including
in Afghanistan. The Government of Afghanistan has
taken steps to improve gender equality in the civil
service. We also welcome the enactment of by the
Afghan Parliament of the new Law on the Elimination
of Violence against Women, which is awaiting the
President?€?s approval to enter into force. We appreciate
and commend the efforts of the Government of
Afghanistan to implement the new Law and resolution
1325 (2000), on women and peace and security. We hope
that the Afghan Government will pursue such efforts in
order to uphold the best interests of Afghan society."
208,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,207,,,,,,,,"In conclusion, the State of Kuwait believes that
lasting peace and stability in Afghanistan and the
region can be achieved only through a negotiated
diplomatic settlement. History teaches us that military
solutions do not lead to lasting peaceful settlements. We
therefore urge all parties to participate constructively
in the efforts to achieve peace through diplomacy in
the interests and well-being of the Afghan people. Such
diplomatic efforts should be coupled with significant
and genuine investment in education, with which any
true societal reform begins. Many nations torn apart by
war, conflict and destruction have been able to recover"
209,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,208,,,,,,,,"and join the ranks of developed countries because they
invested in the education of future generations and
allocated resources to education without discrimination
between men and women. | think the best way to
conclude my remarks would be to quote Nelson
Mandela, the late former President of South Africa,
who said, ?€?Education is the most powerful weapon we
can use to change the world?€?."
210,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,209,,,,,,,,"Mrs. Gueguen (France) (spoke in French): I would
like to begin by warmly thanking all the speakers,
and in particular Ms. Sarabi and Ms. Safi, for their
informative briefings. I also thank the Netherlands for
taking the initiative to hold this important debate on
8 March, on the occasion of International Women?€?s Day,
which is also being celebrated in French, as we heard
from Ambassador Vassilenko. The country of Simone
de Beauvoir, Marie Curie and Simone Veil ?€? my
country ?€? takes this day very seriously. President
Macron has made promoting equality between men and
women the major cause of his five-year term. I will make
four comments today on the situation in Afghanistan."
211,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,210,,,,,,,,"My first comment concerns the fragile security
situation, which Ms. Safi described to us and which is
illustrated in particular by the recent terrorist attacks
on Kabul and Jalalabad and their impact on the Afghan
population. France firmly condemns those terrorist
attacks, which once again targeted Afghan civilians,
especially women and children. We reiterate our
sympathy and support for the victims of that cowardly
and hateful violence and for their families."
212,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,211,,,,,,,,"As the report of the Secretary-General (S/2018/165)
emphasizes, the level of violence in Afghanistan has
grown in recent months as a result of the ongoing
threat posed by the Taliban and the increased presence
of Da?€?esh, which Mr. Yamamoto mentioned just now.
France calls for all parties to protect civilians and
welcomes the efforts of the Afghan authorities in that
regard, as well as the determination of the Afghan
security forces in their fight against terrorism. France
also welcomes the commitments made in Kabul on
28 February by all of Afghanistan?€?s neighbours,
and other international partners, to increasing their
cooperation with the Afghan authorities in order to
combat the double threat of terrorism and transnational
organized crime. The ongoing efforts of the Government
of Afghanistan and its international partners to fight
drug trafficking deserve special emphasis and should be
further strengthened, including within the framework
of the Paris Pact Initiative."
213,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,212,,,,,,,,"Women are dying of terrorist violence in
Afghanistan, but they are also victims of other types of
violence related to the Afghan conflict. In particular,
we condemn the executions of women ordered by the
Taliban courts andthe numerous cases of sexual violence,
of which there have been more than 170 verified cases
in 2017. We welcome the Afghan Government?€?s launch
of an action plan to eliminate early marriages for the
period from 2017 to 2021, which we hope will help to
end that deplorably widespread practice."
214,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,213,,,,,,,,"Secondly, I would like to refer to the ongoing efforts
to arrive at a lasting political solution to the conflict
in Afghanistan. Since our last debate, in December
2017 (see S/PV.8147), progress has been made with an
Afghan-led peace process. The proposal for peace talks
without preconditions, made by President Ashraf Ghani
to the Taliban at the second Kabul Process conference
on 28 February, is a positive development. Along with
the countries and international organizations that are
participants in the Kabul process, France supports this
peace proposal, which offers the Taliban recognition as
a political force. However, we also want to emphasize
our demand that the Taliban renounce all violence.
France welcomes the efforts of the Afghan authorities
to establish a broad national consensus in support of
the peace proposal and encourages them to continue
along this path, particularly by working to ensure the
cohesiveness of the National Unity Government and
avoiding the temptation to retreat into communities or
ethnic groups, as well as by ensuring women?€?s active
participation at all levels of decision-making."
215,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,214,,,,,,,,"With regard to that last point, we should note the
significant progress that has been achieved, especially
in the increase in the number of women in the High
Peace Council, as Ms. Sarabi mentioned today. The
gradual implementation of the national action plan
on the women and peace and security agenda is
essential in that respect. The time has come to make
a qualitative leap and ensure that Afghan women can
fully participate in all decision-making processes. That
should begin, for example, with greater participation in
the joint secretariat of the High Council, in which there
are currently only three women. There can be no lasting
peace without the active and effective participation of
Afghan women in the process, and that must be an
integral part of the national consensus forged during
the second Kabul conference. Finally, France urges all
partners in Afghanistan, especially its neighbours, to
support and facilitate this inclusive peace process. The"
216,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,215,,,,,,,,"Security Council should also make itself available in
support of that process.

My third comment concerns the elections, which
are the other high priority for Afghanistan in 2018 and
2019. While progress has been made with electoral
reform and the preparations led by the Independent
Electoral Commission, there is still a long way to
go. France encourages the Afghan Government to
continue its efforts to fulfil its responsibilities, with the
support of the United Nations Assistance Mission in
Afghanistan (UNAMA) and its international partners,
in order to guarantee the holding of free, transparent
and inclusive local and parliamentary elections before
the end of the year. In that regard, as resolution 2405
(2018), which we have just adopted, emphasizes,
it is essential to ensure that women are able to fully
participate in the electoral processes as voters and
candidates. That means renewed efforts to make sure
that people understand the importance of everyone?€?s
vote, including through awareness-raising campaigns.
That participation also means that women who have
decided to run as candidates must be protected and
assisted, and that those who have not yet dared to run
should be encouraged to do so. On this 8 March, we
also hope that the willingness of the Afghan authorities
to give women their rightful place will result in equal
access to education."
217,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,216,,,,,,,,"My fourth and last remark concerns the importance
of international support, and in particular UNAMA, for
Afghanistan. Following the Council?€?s visit to Kabul in
January, the unanimous adoption of resolution 2405
(2018), renewing the Mission?€?s mandate, is another
demonstration of the international community?€?s
unwavering support for Afghanistan. By endorsing the
recommendations of the strategic review conducted in
the summer of 2017, the resolution enables UNAMA to
refocus on its core missions in support of peace efforts
and the preparation of the elections."
218,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,217,,,,,,,,"I pay tribute to the remarkable work done by
your delegation, Madam President, in the conduct
of the negotiations and I congratulate you on this
excellent result.

Finally, I welcome the Secretary-General?€?s
decision to host the next ministerial conference in
Geneva in November, two years after the Brussels
Donors Conference. It will demonstrate once again our
collective and lasting commitment to peace, security
and development in Afghanistan."
219,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,218,,,,,,,,"Allow me in conclusion to reiterate France?€?s full
support for the Afghan Government in the search for
lasting peace for all Afghan women and men, and
for United Nations personnel working in particularly
difficult conditions.

The President: I remind all speakers to limit their
statements to no more than five minutes in order to
enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously."
220,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,219,,,,,,,,"I now give the floor to the Minister for Foreign
Affairs of Australia.

Ms. Bishop (Australia): After decades of conflict,
the Afghan National Security Forces continue to
make daily sacrifices in their efforts to protect their
communities, while the Afghan people continue to
suffer the ravages of terrorism and conflict. It remains
vital that the international community continue to
stand with the Afghan people in their efforts to defeat
terrorism and pursue peaceful development."
221,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,220,,,,,,,,"The struggle against extremist ideology of groups
like the Taliban is existential for many communities.
There is no place in our world for a doctrine that defines
women and girls as second-class citizens, and where
young girls have their hopes and dreams crushed by an
ideology that deprives them of education, respect and
free will. There are many reasons for our support for
the Afghan Government; however, few are as important
as the future welfare of the women and girls of that
beautiful country."
222,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,221,,,,,,,,"On this International Women?€?s Day, we commit
anew to the courageous women and girls of Afghanistan.
Australia will maintain our 300-strong commitment to
the NATO-led Resolute Support mission to train, advise
and assist the Afghan Security Forces, and our annual
$100-million commitment to its support. The Australian
Government reiterates our condemnation of the actions
of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham (ISIS) and
ISIS-inspired groups, Al-Qaida, its affiliates and other
terrorist groups, including in Afghanistan. In February,
Australia listed the Islamic State-Khorasan Province
for counter-terrorism-targeted financial sanctions."

Afghanistan?€?s development, including by providing
$1.34 billion in development assistance. Sustainable
economic growth is the key to lifting more Afghan
people out of poverty. We are seeing advances, with
women and girls now having opportunities for education
and economic participation while their rights are being"
224,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,223,,,,,,,,"codified in Afghanistan?€?s laws. Women, at least as
much as men, must win the peace in Afghanistan,
and we support their participation in the upcoming
elections, both as candidates and as citizens exercising
their democratic rights. More work is needed to ensure
that Afghans can fulfil their potential, including those
displaced due to the ongoing humanitarian crisis."
225,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,224,,,,,,,,"Australia continues to support Afghanistan?€?s
efforts to reintegrate displaced people and returnees
and to meet the humanitarian and development
needs of its citizens. Today I announce a $60-million
humanitarian support package to assist Afghanistan?€?s
refugees, displaced people and their host communities
in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Australia will continue
to support Afghanistan?€?s efforts in responding to the
ongoing challenges of food security, safety and health
needs, particularly of vulnerable women and children."
226,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,225,,,,,,,,"Afghanistan needs enduring peace to fulfil its
undoubted potential that can only come through
negotiation and dialogue. The November 2018
ministerial conference in Geneva will provide the
opportunity for Afghanistan to demonstrate progress
towards a political settlement, give priority its
development needs and build international confidence.
The Australian Government acknowledges the
commitment of the Afghan Government and people,
and the bravery of the Afghan security forces in their
determination to end conflict. We also appreciate the
valuable contribution of all United Nations agencies,
diplomatic partners and their staff in Afghanistan."
227,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,226,,,,,,,,"Like all people, Afghans want to live their lives
in peace and security and strive for higher standards

representative of Germany.

Mrs. Purschel (Germany): Let me_ thank
Mr. Yamamoto, the Special Representative of the
Secretary-General; Ms. Sarabi, Deputy Chairperson
of the High Peace Council; and Ms. Safi, Executive
Director of the Organization for Policy Research and
Development Studies, for their comprehensive briefings."
229,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,228,,,,,,,,"Germany aligns itself with the statement to be
delivered by the observer of the European Union.

To start, I would like to commend the National
Unity Government for holding the second Kabul
Process conference on 28 February, despite the series of
atrocious attacks only weeks earlier. This is a testament
to the courage of the Afghan people. There is no purely
military solution to this conflict. After so many years,
the Taliban have achieved none of their objectives and
they never will. All they can do is prolong the misery
of their own people."
230,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,229,,,,,,,,"The only sustainable solution is a negotiated
peace without losers. President Ghani?€?s offer to enter
into talks with the Taliban without preconditions is an
important step towards such an intra-Afghan peace
process. The participants in the Kabul conference
lent their full support to this offer; now it is up to the
Taliban to respond."
231,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,230,,,,,,,,"Furthermore, we are encouraged by the steps taken
to prepare for the parliamentary and district council
elections. The presentation of the voter registration
concept and the appointment of a new member to
the Afghan Independent Election Commission gave
new impetus to the process. The postponement of the
election from July to a later date in 2018 seems realistic.
However, the electoral preparations must be accelerated
to hold the elections within this year."
232,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,231,,,,,,,,"As the Secretary-General notes in his report
(S/2018/165), the number of security related incidents in
2017 was the highest everrecorded. We deeply deplore the
high number of civilian lives lost ?€? especially the lives
of so many children ?€? and we condemn the particularly
brutal series of attacks by anti-Government elements at
the beginning of this year. The Afghan Security Forces
continue to stand on the front line in this fight against
terrorism. We applaud the envisaged security sector
reforms that aim to improve the professionalism of the
Afghan National Army, especially by retiring several
hundred generals and bringing on a new generation of
military leaders."
233,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,232,,,,,,,,"To train, advise and assist the Afghan National
Security Forces, Germany intends to increase the
number of its troops committed to the Resolute Support
Mission by approximately 300, to a total of up to 1,300
soldiers. We will then be the second-largest troop
contributor to the Mission after the United States.

We also welcome the fact that further efforts have
been made to strengthen the legal and the anti-corruption
framework. The recently adopted amendments to the
penal code may help to reduce war crimes, and the"
234,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,233,,,,,,,,"adoption of the Law on Declaration and Registration
of Assets of State Officials and Employees will yield
visible progress in fighting corruption and foster the
rule of law if implemented correctly.

We thank the Kingdom of the Netherlands for
putting a women, peace and security focus on today?€?s
debate. This emphasis is much welcome and important,
and not just because it is International Women?€?s Day."
235,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,234,,,,,,,,"I would like to commend the intention of the
Afghan Government to increase the representation of
women in the civil service to 24 per cent by the end
of this year, in line with Afghanistan?€?s national action
plan on resolution 1325 (2000). At the same time, I
would like to put particular emphasis on the importance
of enforcing the Law on the Elimination of Violence
against Women. Too many reported cases remain
unheard by the competent courts. In that context, let
me also thank the United Nations Assistance Mission
in Afghanistan (UNAMA) for its excellent work in
tracking the human rights situation across the country,
most recently through its annual report on the protection
of civilians."
236,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,235,,,,,,,,"Germany continues to support UNAMA and
United Nations agencies working in Afghanistan. We
welcome the renewal of the UNAMA mandate today.
It is particularly important that the Security Council
endorse the outcome of the strategic review to give
the Mission a reliable basis for planning the necessary
adjustments. As on previous occasions, I would like to
stress that the important tasks of the now abolished Rule
of Law Unit should be fully integrated into UNAMA?€?s
core activities."
237,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,236,,,,,,,,"Let me conclude by inviting all participants in
this meeting to a movie screening in German House

women on this important day, we are proud to present
the first international screening of the documentary We
the Women of Afghanistan: a silent revolution. We are
pleased that Afghanistan, Canada and the Netherlands

representative of Turkey.

Mr. Sinirlioglu (Turkey): I would like to thank
Special Representative Yamamoto and the other
briefers for their briefings, and Ambassador Saikal for
his statement. We also thank the Secretary General for
his report. (S/2018/165)

As we mark International Women?€?s Day today,
it is time to recognize and reflect on the enormous
achievements of Afghan women and girls. It is
truly heartening to see empowered women and
girls in Afghanistan who participate in different
spheres of life. They strive for and contribute to the
prosperous and peaceful future of their country.
They merit the admiration and full support of the
international community."
239,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,238,,,,,,,,"We cannot emphasize strongly enough the need to
consolidate the achievements of the past 17 years in
Afghanistan. This requires the sustained support of the
international community to the Afghan Government
and people. In that understanding, we applaud the
greater attention paid by the Security Council to the
situation in Afghanistan. We also commend the role
played by the United Nations Assistance Mission in
Afghanistan (UNAMA) in standing with the Afghan
people and coordinating the efforts of the international
stakeholders in Afghanistan. We will continue to
support UNAMA?€?s activities and efforts. In this
context, we welcome the adoption of resolution 2405
(2018), renewing the mandate of UNAMA."
240,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,239,,,,,,,,"Afghanistan is at yet another critical juncture.
Addressing the challenge of establishing sustained
peace, stability and security in the country remains
central. In that understanding, Turkey was represented
at the second Kabul Process conference, held on
28 February. At the meeting, we reiterated that lasting
peace in Afghanistan could be achieved through an
Afghan-led and Afghan-owned process. We also made
a call on all the groups in Afghanistan to denounce
violence, recognize the Government of Afghanistan
and become part of the legitimate political life of the
country. We hope that the call made at the meeting
by President Ghani for peace negotiations without
preconditions will receive a positive response from the
Taliban. Meanwhile, we also believe that, the National
Unity Government needs to be more inclusive in order
to overcome ethnic tensions and garner the support of
all segments of Afghan society in this critical period."
241,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,240,,,,,,,,"Strengthened collaboration among the countries of
the region is crucial to the success of Afghanistan. Our
vision for Afghanistan is a peaceful and stable country
that enjoys good and cooperative relations with its
neighbours, while being at the centre of major regional
projects. We are confident that this cooperation could
be achieved through dialogue and stronger engagement.
Accordingly, Turkey will continue to contribute to"
242,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,241,,,,,,,,"regional cooperation efforts, including through the
Heart of Asia-Istanbul Process.

In concluding, I would like to reiterate Turkey?€?s
commitment to standing by our Afghan sisters and

Mr. Lambertini (Italy): At the outset, allow me

assumption of the presidency of the Security Council.
We are very proud of the close collaboration between
our two countries in the framework of our split term.
Allow me to say that it is a personal pleasure to see you
in that position, Madam."

some points in my national capacity."
245,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,244,,,,,,,,"We also welcome today?€?s unanimous adoption of
resolution 2405 (2018), on the renewal of the mandate of
the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan
(UNAMA). The Mission plays a vital role in the
partnership between Afghanistan and the international
community in the face of extremely complex challenges
and difficult conditions on the ground. From its efforts
to facilitate the peace process to the delicate issues
revolving around electoral processes and reforms, we
strongly appreciate and support UNAMA?€?s contribution."
246,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,245,,,,,,,,"We condemn in the strongest terms the terrorist
attacks that have taken place in Afghanistan and its
capital in the past weeks. We extend our heartfelt
condolences to the Afghan Government and to the
families of the victims. The intensity of the conflict
remains worryingly high, with tragic effects on the
population, as UNAMA?€?s regular reporting on civilian
casualties continues to assess. In this difficult context,
we welcome President Ghani?€?s courageous peace
offer, as presented at the second conference of the
Kabul Process, which took place last week. This offer
represents a tangible demonstration that the Afghan
authorities are determined to pursue the objective of
peace through dialogue with insurgent groups."
247,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,246,,,,,,,,"The National Unity Government?€?s proposal opens
a political window of opportunity for the peace and
reconciliation process, which must be explored and
pursued to its fullest potential. We therefore hope that
the Taliban will grasp the significance of this opening

by accepting the Government?€?s invitation to come to the
table in the spirit of sincere dialogue, with the shared
objective of putting an end to the conflict and thereby
opening the way to a future of peace and prosperity for
Afghanistan and its people."
248,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,247,,,,,,,,"We are aware that bringing about the conditions for
a meaningful peace process is not an easy task. Every
effort must be made in order to give substance to the
road map. To further this objective, it will be crucial to
generate a broad national consensus in support of the
peace process. We therefore appreciate and encourage
the commitment of the Government and its relevant
institutions to maintaining and strengthening its efforts
to reach out to all components of Afghan society on the
basis of a truly inclusive approach."
249,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,248,,,,,,,,"In this context, it is essential that Afghan women
be given the opportunity to play a primary and active
role, first and foremost in order to ensure that the rights
enshrined in the Constitution and the broader civil and
social gains made in the past 16 years are protected and
promoted. We strongly appreciate the Government?€?s
commitment in this regard, which should be reflected
in its road map for peace."
250,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,249,,,,,,,,"The support of the Afghan people for the peace
process will also be strengthened by the necessary
cohesion between various political groups, as well as
the ability of the Government to meet the needs of the
population by enacting the necessary reforms. Ensuring
that the upcoming parliamentary and presidential
elections are held in a timely, transparent and inclusive
manner will certainly provide an important contribution
to this goal."
251,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,250,,,,,,,,"Terrorism and violent extremism continue to pose
a formidable obstacle on the road to peace. A decisive,
common effort against this grave threat to the security
and stability of Afghanistan remains a key factor. Italy
continues to play its part in this regard in the framework
of the Resolute Support Mission by providing a
significant contribution to strengthen the capacities of
the Afghan National Security and Defence Forces.

To be fully successful in defeating terrorist groups,
however, it is also necessary to bring about a close and
genuine collaboration between regional stakeholders.
This also applies to the fight against transnational
criminal networks and drug trafficking. We therefore
encourage all efforts geared towards making concrete
progress in terms of a constructive dialogue and
effective cooperation between neighbouring countries"
252,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,251,,,,,,,,"on the basis of a common understanding that this kind
of win-win cooperation can bring tangible benefits to
all parties.

The President: I now give the floor to the
representative of Pakistan.

Ms. Lodhi (Pakistan): This debate is taking place
at an important inflection point in the 17-year history of
the current conflict in Afghanistan. Pakistan strongly
condemns the recent spate of terrorist attacks in
Afghanistan. There is no justification for attacks that
kill or maim innocent children, women and men."
253,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,252,,,,,,,,"The report of the Secretary-General (S/2018/165)
paints a grim and bleak picture of the situation in
Afghanistan ?€? a continued political impasse that
threatens the country?€?s unity, an economy in stress and
decline, corruption, drug production and trafficking
and a security environment that in 2017 witnessed a
67 per cent spike in airstrikes, an increase in terrorist
attacks and the highest number of civilian casualties
ever recorded in Afghanistan. Moreover, the continuing
presence of large numbers of terrorist groups and
foreign terrorist fighters in Afghanistan pose a threat to
the long-term stability of Afghanistan, its neighbours,
including my country, and the entire region."
254,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,253,,,,,,,,"Against that troubled backdrop, President Ashraf
Ghani?€?s recent proposal for a dignified process of
talks without preconditions with the Taliban offers an
opportunity to construct and initiate a credible peace
process. For over a decade now, Pakistan has advocated
the restoration of peace in Afghanistan through a
negotiated settlement between Kabul and the Afghan
Taliban. The international community has also endorsed
the goal of a negotiated settlement promoted through an
Afghan-led and Afghan-owned reconciliation process
as the best, and indeed only, way to realize lasting
peace, stability and prosperity in Afghanistan."
255,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,254,,,,,,,,"Pakistan will play its part in encouraging the
initiation of such a dignified negotiation process. We
reiterate and renew our call on the Taliban to renounce
violence and agree to join the peace talks. However,
the task ahead is complex, arduous and delicate. Above
all, seizing the opportunity requires an understanding
that the simultaneous resort to more kinetic actions, the
escalation of military force to shift the battlefield, will
evoke an escalation of attacks by the insurgents and
erode, rather than advance, the prospect of initiating
the envisaged peace process. After 17 years, both the
Afghan Government and its coalition allies, as well

as the Taliban, should have learned that neither can
impose a military victory on the other. The renewed
escalation of force will impose further suffering on the
people of Afghanistan."
256,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,255,,,,,,,,"Secondly, while the talks would be Afghan-led and
Afghan-owned, other parties involved, including the
United States, would need to engage in and contribute
to the negotiation process.

Thirdly, some regional Powers and Afghan parties
have remained consistently hostile to reconciliation
between the Afghan Government and the Afghan
Taliban. The international community must oppose
their anticipated effort to derail the peace process
outlined by President Ashraf Ghani."
257,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,256,,,,,,,,"Fourthly, there is growing and widespread concern
regarding the rapid increase in the presence of Da?€?esh
in Afghanistan. A recent report notes that the Afghan
Government controls only 18 per cent of the country?€?s
districts and has influence in an additional 38 per cent.
The rest, sadly, is ungoverned. It is in the ungoverned
and uncontested spaces in Afghanistan?€?s north and east
that Da?€?esh and its affiliates are installing themselves
and threatening Afghanistan and its neighbours. The
elimination of Da?€?esh and its affiliates must be accorded
high priority in the endeavour to achieve lasting peace
in the region."
258,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,257,,,,,,,,"Fifthly, the power of assorted terrorist groups and
criminal gangs in Afghanistan cannot be broken when
they continue to receive a steady stream of revenue
from drug production and drug trafficking. The Afghan
Government and its international partners must brake
the nexus between drug production and terrorism."
259,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,258,,,,,,,,"Pakistan, my country, has the highest stake in
a peaceful and stable Afghanistan. My country has
suffered gravely due to the decades of war, violence and
terrorism emanating from our neighbouring country.
Over the past four years, Pakistan has successfully
turned the tide against terrorism by conducting the
largest and most sustained anti-terrorism campaign
anywhere in the world, with the deployment of over
200,000 of our troops. That campaign will continue
until all terrorists, without distinction, are eliminated."
260,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,259,,,,,,,,"Today the threat of terrorism in Pakistan emanates
principally from outside of our borders. As Pakistan?€?s
army chief, General Qamar Bajwa, noted in remarks
to the recent Munich Security Conference, of the 131
terrorist attacks on our territory, 123 were conceived,"
261,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,260,,,,,,,,"planned and executed from Afghanistan. That is
happening despite the presence of the most powerful
military alliance in Afghanistan. We want to see the
elimination of the sanctuaries where those terrorists
operate against my country."
262,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,261,,,,,,,,"Pakistan also requires effective cooperation from
Kabul and the coalition forces to control and manage
the long border between Pakistan and Afghanistan. My
country has nearly 1,000 border posts, but on the other
side there are only 220. In one stretch of 648 kilometres,
there is not a single Afghan post. Yet the responsibility
for containing regional terrorism and cross-border
movement is placed on my country. Pakistan plans to
fence and electronically monitor the entire border with
Afghanistan. That project should be actively supported
by the international community and Afghanistan."
263,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,262,,,,,,,,"My country has offered unprecedented hospitality
and support to the Afghan people, our brothers and
sisters, over the past several decades of their travail
and tragedy provoked by internal strife and foreign
military interventions. We continue to host the largest
protracted presence of refugees anywhere in the
world and have delayed sending them back again on
compassionate grounds."
264,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,263,,,,,,,,"Finally, as Pakistan, the Afghan Government and
the coalition work together to evolve an agreed course
of action for peace and stability in Afghanistan, it is
essential that all parties refrain from campaigns of
vilification and coercion. Pakistan?€?s cooperation cannot
be garnered by pressure or intimidation.

To conclude, allow me to convey a message
from my Government and my people to our sisters in
Afghanistan. We stand with them in support of their
rights and liberty. We regard an assault on their rights
as a threat to our rights, and indeed to the rights of
women everywhere. We are together in the pursuit of
our shared goal to ensure a life of dignity and liberty
for every girl and every woman, wherever they may be."
265,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,264,,,,,,,,"The President: I now give the floor to the
representative of Canada.

Mr. Bonser (Canada) (spoke in French): I
would like to thank you, Madam President, for this
opportunity to address the Security Council on the
situation in Afghanistan on the special occasion of
International Women?€?s Day. Canada thanks the United
Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA)
for keeping Member States apprised of progress made"

Special Representative of the Secretary-General, for his
briefing on, and tireless work in favour of, Afghanistan."
267,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,266,,,,,,,,"(spoke in English)

Allow me to join others in conveying our sincere
condolences to the people of Afghanistan in the
wake of recent violent attacks in Kabul and across
the country. We are disheartened by the toll such
attacks take on civilians, in particular on women and
children. While UNAMA?€?s recent report of a 9 per cent
decrease in civilian casualties in 2017 ?€? as compared
to 2016 ?€? is an improvement, any civilian casualties
are unacceptable."
268,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,267,,,,,,,,"There are three themes that I will address today:
the peace and reconciliation process, the meaningful
participation of women in all aspects of Afghan society
and progress on human rights."
269,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,268,,,,,,,,"First, in the wake of the spike in recent violence,
it is now more essential than ever that the Afghan
Government, the armed insurgency and all parties
in the conflict come to the table for sincere peace
negotiations. In that regard, we urge the Taliban and
other insurgent groups to cease to use violence and to
engage in a negotiated peace. Peace and reconciliation
in Afghanistan must be Afghan-owned and Afghan-
led. In support of that, Canada commends both the
Afghan Government for convening the Kabul Process
on 28 February and Afghanistan?€?s neighbours for their
efforts to work with the Government of Afghanistan
towards a more peaceful and stable region."
270,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,269,,,,,,,,"That brings me to my second point, namely, the
inclusion of women in all aspects of society, including
peace processes. For a peaceful, stable and prosperous
future to be achieved, women must be included, on
equal footing as men, in decision-making at all levels
of politics, society and the economy. Canada?€?s national
action plan on women and peace and security recognizes
that peace is more enduring, stable and inclusive when
women are actively engaged in such processes. For that
reason, women must be given a prominent role in peace
negotiations at all levels and in all venues. As women
currently hold less than a third of parliamentary seats in
Afghanistan, it is especially important that we ensure
women are meaningfully included as both candidates
and informed voters in the upcoming elections."
271,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,270,,,,,,,,"The last theme I will address today is human
rights. Promoting and protecting human rights, with a

focus on women and girls, is at the core of Canada?€?s
engagement in Afghanistan. Although there has been
notable progress made in that area, women continue
to be at a disadvantage as compared to men. Ongoing
violence, moreover, continues to deliberately and
disproportionately target marginalized ethnic and
religious groups, journalists, human rights activists and
civil society organizations. That is deplorable, and has
not gone un-noticed."
272,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,271,,,,,,,,"Canada remains committed to advancing the rights
of all Afghans by helping to improve governance
systems, increasing the capacity of Afghan institutions
and meeting the basic needs of the Afghan people,
especially women and girls. That includes supporting
the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces;
improving access to safe, quality education and health
services; and fostering greater economic opportunities.
Canada, moreover, remains a significant contributor
to the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights
Commission, a leading defender of human rights in
the country."
273,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,272,,,,,,,,"We were pleased to see that the Council has renewed
the mandate of the United Nations Assistance Mission
in Afghanistan for a further 12 months. The Council
can count on Canada as a committed partner to help
Afghans create a more equitable, just and sustainable
future for all. We will continue to stand-by Afghanistan
in its efforts towards peace and regional stability."
274,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,273,,,,,,,,"The President: I now give the floor to the
representative of India.

Mr. Akbaruddin (India): Since the start of this
year there has been sharper focus by the Security
Council on issues relating to Afghanistan. The
Council members?€? visit to Afghanistan, the ministerial
debate on Afghanistan and regional connectivity (see
S/PV.8162) and the enhanced focus by the Chairman
of the Committee established pursuant to resolution
1988 (2011) on the situation in the country all bode
well for the attention that the worsening situation in
Afghanistan necessitates."
275,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,274,,,,,,,,"I thank you, Madam President, for following that
welcome trend and organizing today?€?s debate. We also
thank Ambassador Yamamoto, Special Representative
of the Secretary-General, for sharing his insights on
the prospects for peace ahead of us in 2018. We also
appreciate the eloquent portrayals of the strides made
by Afghan women and what more needs to be done in
that regard."
276,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,275,,,,,,,,"The report (S/2018/165) of the Secretary General
has highlighted what we feared. The year 2017 was
perhaps the worst year in terms of civilian causalities
and security incidents in Afghanistan. Thousands
of innocent and precious Afghan lives fell prey to
mindless violence. It is in that context that we welcome
the adoption of resolution 2405 (2018), which extends
the mandate of the United Nations Assistance Mission
in Afghanistan (UNAMA), as an affirmation of the
collective objective of support for the Afghan people.
The brave Afghan people must not lose hope, and we,
the international community, must not lose heart."
277,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,276,,,,,,,,"We specifically welcome the Council?€?s focus on
linkages among extremism, terrorism, drug production
and the illegal exploitation of the natural resources of
Afghanistan. The increase in the cultivation of poppy
in the areas under the control of the Taliban and the
Taliban?€?s involvement in virtually all aspects of the
opium trade suggest that it is akin to a drug cartel. We
hope that the Council will better utilize the range of
tools available to it to deal with those transnational
networks of drugs, terrorism and crime."
278,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,277,,,,,,,,"Despite the international community?€?s efforts,
those supporting the terrorists affecting Afghanistan
have not been deterred. There are still those who provide
sanctuaries to support the dark agendas of terrorist
organizations like the Taliban, the Haqqani Network,
the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham, Al-Qaida,
Lashkar-e-Tayyiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed. Indeed, the
challenges posed by cross-border terrorism emanating
from safe havens and sanctuaries to Afghanistan and to
our region must be addressed."
279,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,278,,,,,,,,"Today being International Women?€?s Day, we join
in acknowledging that women are perhaps the worst-
affected by the protracted conflict and violence in
Afghanistan. Notwithstanding the continuing conflict
situation, Afghanistan has come a long way since the
days of the Taliban, who had reduced women to less
than second-class citizens under a despotic regime.
Women in the country are no longer imprisoned in their
homes and are making progress in all sectors, from
technology to athletics and from transportation to the
civil service. As we heard earlier, they are committed to
continuing their struggles in order to play a significant
role in building a progressive and stable society. Afghan
women have achieved a lot in the two recent decades.
We must not allow those gains to be lost or wasted."
280,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,279,,,,,,,,"India has invested over $2 billion in Afghanistan
since 2002 in the reconstruction and development of
the country. A major focus of our work has been on
nearly 550 high-impact community development
projects, which cut across areas such as education,
health, agriculture and irrigation, power and energy.
All of them have a direct bearing on improving the lives
of all Afghans, including girls and women, specially so
for projects in the education and health-care sectors."
281,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,280,,,,,,,,"Indian women?€?s non-governmental orgainzations
have undertaken various activities in Afghanistan
such, as vocational training of Afghan women in India,
as well as establishing women?€?s vocational training
centres in various provinces of Afghanistan. They have
been working for almost a decade with poor women
workers and sending them for training-of-trainers
sessions in India. To date, 150 women trainers have
been trained in India out of the target of 200 up until
May 2018. In addition, more than 3,000 Afghan women
have been trained in Kabul and other provinces in
Afghanistan to help them to establish a women?€?s self-
help organizations in Kabul. During the past three years,
about 5,000 Afghan female students have been trained
under various higher education scholarship schemes.
Moreover, several rural women from Afghanistan have
been trained at the Barefoot College in Rajasthan, India,
in the field of solar electrification. We will continue
our work on the ground to help the women and girls of
Afghanistan become self-reliant and capable of playing
an effective part in the reconstruction of their country."
282,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,281,,,,,,,,"If we are to preserve the achievements of Afghan
women and girls, the international community must
continue to extend its full support to an Afghan-led
and Afghan-owned peace and reconciliation process.
The Afghan National Unity Government recently
once again issued a new call for peace and proposed a
concrete approach to the Taliban to join the mainstream.
The Afghan Government?€?s willingness for peace is
despite the fact that armed groups have identified
themselves and demonstrated to all of us that they
are the irreconcilables. Those efforts by the Afghan
Government calling on the armed groups to cease
violence and join the national peace and reconciliation
process, which would protect the rights of all Afghans,
including women, children and minorities, deserve
our full support. However, it should also be clear to
the armed opposition that there will be no tolerance
for those who continue violence. Any violence needs"
283,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,282,,,,,,,,"a robust response. The irreconcilable guns need to
be silenced.

The indomitable courage of the Afghan people,
the spirit of the Afghan youth and the strength of their
dreams are a source of collective pride for our region.
India is committed to continuing its efforts to strengthen
that spirit by supporting all initiatives designed to end
violence and bring back peace.

The President: I now give the floor to the
representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran.

Mr. Khoshroo (Iran): I would like to express
my appreciation to the Netherlands presidency for
organizing today?€?s debate. I also thank the Ambassador
of Afghanistan for his statement. I would like to
thank Mr. Yamamoto, Special Representative of the
Secretary-General for Afghanistan and Head of the
United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan
(UNAMA), for his briefing on the Secretary-General?€?s
most recent report (S/2018/165)."
284,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,283,,,,,,,,"Unfortunately, security remains the major challenge
for Afghanistan. According to the Secretary-General?€?s
report, 2017 ended with the highest level of security-
related incidents ever recorded. A wave of deadly,
complex attacks, in particular three major attacks in
Kabul with hundreds of fatalities, continued throughout
January 2018. The Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant-
Khorasan Province remained operationally resilient,
thereby exacerbating the volatile security situation as
conflict between the Government and terrorists, as
well as extremist groups, continued throughout most of
the country."
285,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,284,,,,,,,,"Iran continues to support the promotion of security
and stability and comprehensive and_ sustainable
development in Afghanistan. It supports any Afghan-
led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled call
for a reconciliation and peace process. It is in that
context that we agreed to participate in the Kabul
Process ?€? and endorsed its final declaration in
February this year ?€? and in similar processes to help
achieve peace and security in Afghanistan."
286,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,285,,,,,,,,"The Afghan National Unity Government is in
the forefront of fighting terrorism, in particular the
Taliban, Al-Qaida, Da?€?esh and its affiliates, as well as
other terrorists and extremist groups and criminals.
The sustained support of the international community
is needed to support the Afghan Government in that"
287,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,286,,,,,,,,"fight and to address its complex security, economic and
political challenges.

Strengthening our regional cooperation with
Afghanistan is a priority and a major step towards
consolidating peace and improving its economic status
in the region. In that regard, I would like to express my
sincere appreciation to Kazakhstan for its initiative to
organize a ministerial debate on regional partnership
in Afghanistan and Central Asia, as a model to link
security and development during its presidency of the
Security Council in January. The world should regard
the situation in Afghanistan not as an opportunity for
competition but as one to establish peace, security and
stability through development ?€? a win-win approach
for Afghanistan and its neighbouring countries,
including those in Central Asia and the international
community in general."
288,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,287,,,,,,,,"For more than three decades, Iran has hosted
millions of Afghan refugees and has shared much
needed subsidized goods and services with them,
including basic commodities, public health and public
education. This year alone, our schools are providing
education to nearly 400,000 undocumented Afghan
students. With that in mind, we welcome and urge
further efforts to strengthen the process of regional
economic cooperation, including measures to facilitate
regional connectivity, trade and transit. Over a
decade and in total, Iran has funded more than 300
development projects, including reconstruction and
building infrastructure totalling $500 million. Such
projects have the capacity to change regional economic
perspectives and can help prosperity and stability
in Afghanistan."
289,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,288,,,,,,,,"During the reporting period, trade through Iran?€?s
Bandar Abbas and Chabahar ports increased as of early
2017, marking a significant shift in Afghanistan?€?s access
to markets and international trade. The findings of the
Afghanistan Opium Survey 2017 of the United Nations
Office on Drugs and Crime, indicating an 87 per cent
growth in opium production, are alarming given the
fact that narcotics provide a major source of income
for terrorist groups. The international community
must support the relevant international and regional
projects and activities, including those carried out by
Afghanistan, the Islamic Republic of Iran and Pakistan,
within the framework of the triangular initiative to
counter narcotics."
290,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,289,,,,,,,,"We reiterate our support for UNAMA and United
Nations agencies in their efforts to provide development
and reconstruction assistance to Afghanistan through
a comprehensive plan. Sustained ownership and
partnership with the Afghan Government are needed in
order to utilize the best potential of UNAMA and the
United Nations system to deliver the necessary services
in priority areas, as advised by the national Government."
291,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,290,,,,,,,,"The General Assembly, through its resolution
64/253, recognized 21 March of each year as the
International Day of Nowruz. Nowruz ?€? ?€?New
Day?€? ?€? is celebrated in many countries, including
Afghanistan. Nowruz has served as the common
inspiration for peace and reconciliation for more than
300 million people around the globe. On the eve of
Nowruz, I would like to express my best wishes to
the fraternal people of Afghanistan, wishing them a
happy Nowruz, and reassure them of Iran?€?s full support
in their endeavour to reach peace and prosperity in
their country."
292,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,291,,,,,,,,"The President: I now give the floor to the observer
of the European Union.

Ms. Adamson: On International Women?€?s Day,

President?€?s chair, Madam.

Ihave the honour to speak on behalf of the European
Union (EU) and its Member States.

The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,
Montenegro, Serbia and Albania, Bosnia and
Herzegovina, as well as Ukraine, the Republic
of Moldova and Georgia, align themselves with
this statement."
293,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,292,,,,,,,,"I would like to thank the Secretary-General for his
comprehensive report (S/2018/165) and strategic review.
I would also like to thank Special Representative
Yamamoto for his briefing.

I express deep sorrow following the terrorist attacks
in January, in particular the three in Kabul that inflicted
hundreds of casualties, as well as the attack against Save
the Children in Jalalabad. I express sincere condolences
to the Afghan people and the Government for the
horrific attacks against Afghan civilians and security
personnel. I reiterate the EU?€?s unwavering engagement
to stand by Afghanistan in the fight against terrorism,
which is a global threat. The EU calls for an in-depth
investigation of those crimes and identification of the
perpetrators, who must be brought to justice."
294,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,293,,,,,,,,"The EU strongly acknowledges the crucial role
played by the United Nations Assistance Mission in
Afghanistan (UNAMA) and all the United Nations
agencies in supporting the Afghan people. The EU
wishes to have the closest and strongest relationship
with UNAMA, both on the ground and in international
forums, for the ultimate benefit of Afghanistan."
295,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,294,,,,,,,,"The EU fully supports an Afghan-led and Afghan-
owned peace process that will bring all Afghans together
and pave the way to a better future for Afghanistan and
the whole region. The EU welcomes the second meeting
of the Kabul Process for Peace and Security Cooperation
on 28 February as an important step towards peace
and reconciliation. The European Union commends all
those that made the conference possible: the Afghan
Government and people, participants, regional actors
and international partners. At the meeting, the Afghan
Government put forward an important and welcome
offer of peace to the Taliban. We encourage the Taliban
to seize that offer and anticipate that it will lead towards
the establishment of a genuine peace process."
296,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,295,,,,,,,,"On 8 February, the EU held its first meeting of the
EU-A fghanistan Joint Committee under the Cooperation
Agreement for Partnership and Development. The
Cooperation Agreement came into force provisionally
as of 1 December 2017 and establishes a formal
bilateral relationship. Ahead of the Joint Committee,
High Representative of the European Union Federica
Mogherini and Afghan Minister of Finance Eklil
Hakimi met and emphasized their strong commitment
to bringing about peace and stability in Afghanistan."
297,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,296,,,,,,,,"Respect for human rights, the full and equal
participation of women and democratic elections
continue to be a focus of the EU?€?s dialogue with the
Afghan authorities and of the EU?€?s actions in the country.
In fact, human rights now form an integral part of the
structured dialogue between the EU and Afghanistan
under the framework that I just mentioned. In 2017, the
human rights situation remained fragile and worrying
in Afghanistan. There were positive achievements with
the adoption of human rights legislation, such as the
revised Penal Code and the Child Rights Protection Law."
298,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,297,,,,,,,,"Progress has also been noted on the implementation
of the national action plan pursuant to resolution 1325
(2000) and on the elimination of violence against women,
for which Afghanistan has prepared an implementation
strategy. However, more needs to be done. The EU is
particularly pleased that the Kabul Process conference"
299,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,298,,,,,,,,"underlined the need to safeguard the achievements
made in the area of women?€?s rights in recent years.
Moreover, the elections scheduled for 2018 and 2019
must ensure the participation of women as candidates,
voters or staff members, thereby safeguarding their
rights as equal citizens.

The death penalty remains a topic of discussion,
and the EU repeats its call for a moratorium. On the
positive side, we note that, in the new Penal Code, the
number of crimes to which capital punishment applies
has been considerably reduced."
300,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,299,,,,,,,,"The EU calls for more concrete and accelerated
actions to implement the anti-corruption strategy
that was adopted, including an _ independent
monitoring mechanism.

With regard to the elections, some progress has
been made on the appointment of the leadership of
the Independent Election Commission and on voter
registration. Electoral preparations for the parliamentary
and district elections must be accelerated. The EU and
its member States remain committed to supporting
the Afghan electoral process. The EU has committed
???15.5 million to that end."
301,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,300,,,,,,,,"The EU and Afghanistan continue to engage
in a comprehensive dialogue on migration. The
implementation of the Joint Way Forward on migration
issues between Afghanistan and the European Union is
part of that discussion, with several planned common
actions related to cooperation on addressing and
preventing irregular migration and on the return of
irregular migrants, the fight against smuggling and
trafficking in human beings and awareness-raising
activities on illegal migration.

The European Commission continues to support
Afghanistan through programmes for Afghan
refugees in neighbouring countries to the amount of
approximately ???200 million. Our aim is to support a
safe, manageable, predictable, voluntary and dignified
return process for Afghan migrants."
302,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,301,,,,,,,,"In 2017, UNAMA documented 10,453 civilian
casualties, which is a decrease of 9 per cent as
compared to 2016. However, the persistently high levels
of violence and the corresponding impact on civilians
remain a deep concern to the EU.

We need to continue to protect the vital role of
humanitarian agencies and to respect their impartiality
and humanitarian space in addressing the most urgent"
303,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,302,,,,,,,,"needs of the most vulnerable. In view of the threat posed
by the many mines and improvised explosive devices,
the EU also encourages Afghanistan to maintain the
current pace of demining. We support the efforts of the
NATO-led Resolute Support Mission to provide further
training, advice and assistance for the Afghan security
forces and institutions."

opium production in Afghanistan by 83 per cent in 2017
as compared to 2016, according to the United Nations
Office on Drugs and Crime. The illegal narcotics
production and trade remain major critical challenges
to the long-term stability and sustainability of the State,
while providing significant funds to anti-Government
forces and criminal networks."
305,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,304,,,,,,,,"To conclude, the recent meeting of the Kabul
Process on peace and security was a clear offer of peace
to the Taliban, and we anticipate that that offer will now
lead to the establishment of a genuine peace process that
is Afghan-led and Afghan-owned. The EU continues
to consider UNAMA a key partner in that. UNAMA
has an invaluable role in ensuring the broadest possible
international support for that Afghan-led and Afghan-
owned process. The EU will continue to support those
efforts with all the means at its disposal."

representative of Belgium.

Mrs. Van Vlierberge (Belgium) (spoke in
French): First of all, as others have done before me,
I would like to convey our deepest condolences to
the Afghan people and their Government for the
terrible attacks against Afghan civilians and security
personnel. Belgium strongly supports the efforts of the
international community to ensure security, stability
and prosperity in Afghanistan. Belgium has made
regular and significant contributions to the Afghanistan
Reconstruction Trust Fund and will continue to invest
in the security of the Afghan people, in particular
by increasing its presence in Afghanistan from 50 to
nearly 100 soldiers next month."

statement made by the observer of the European Union,
in particular by highlighting the indispensable role of
the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan
(UNAMA) and other United Nations agencies in
supporting the Afghan people, promoting peace and
reconciliation, monitoring and promoting human rights,
and coordinating the assistance of the international

community. We also commend the Government
of Afghanistan for acceding to the Convention on
Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain
Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to
Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate
Effects and its five Protocols on 9 August 2017, thereby
demonstrating its commitment to addressing the issues

308,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,307,,,,,,,,"I would like to thank Special Representative
Yamamoto, Ms. Sarabi and Ms. Safi for their briefings
and for their tireless efforts towards lasting peace in
Afghanistan. Allow me to thank you, Madam President,
for organizing this quarterly debate on Afghanistan on
such an auspicious day, International Women?€?s Day, and
only a week after the very successful second conference
of the Kabul Process. Now is the best time to discuss
women and peace and security in Afghanistan."
309,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,308,,,,,,,,"Unfortunately, women continue to suffer the
consequences of the conflict. Last year, the number
of female deaths increased by 5 per cent as compared
to the previous year. That is particularly tragic, since
women also hold the key to more peace and security.
Studies show that a greater participation of women
leads to more effective humanitarian assistance, more
lasting peace agreements and post-conflict recovery.
There is a direct correlation between women?€?s level of
education and sustainable development. Encouraging
women?€?s rights and inclusion is not a matter of political
correctness or moral debate but a proven recipe
for success. That is why the women and peace and
security agenda deserves all the support that we can
collectively provide."
310,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,309,,,,,,,,"We take this opportunity to commend the progress
made by the Government of Afghanistan. The
aforementioned increase in the number of female deaths
is primarily attributable to terrorist suicide bombings.
The casualties attributable to the Government forces
decreased by 19 per cent. Afghanistan has made clear
commitments and has developed an action plan on
women and peace and security. More and more women
hold important Government positions. We also welcome
the recent decree endorsing the Law on the Elimination
of Violence against Women, and we look forward to
its implementation."
311,Afghanistan_Situation_1477081,310,,,,,,,,"No one denies the significant challenges and the
long way to go. A sustained effort will be needed
to increase the essential participation of women in
education, work and decision-making. The upcoming

elections will be an important opportunity to increase
women?€?s participation in public life. Women have a role
to play as voters, activists and political candidates. We
hope that a concerted effort by the Government, the
Independent Election Commission and civil society,
with the support of UNAMA, will make real progress
in that area possible.

Women also played a role in the recent success of
the second meeting of the Kabul Process as members
of the High Peace Council or through the support of
women?€?s organizations for the peace offer put on
the table. Belgium fully supports the declaration of the

Kabul peace process and congratulates the Government
of Afghanistan on having obtained broad national and
international support for a generous and concrete peace
offer. It is now up to the Taliban to answer. We also
commend the Government of Uzbekistan for organizing
an international conference on peace and development
in Afghanistan in Tashkent at the end of this month.
International and especially regional support for
Afghanistan?€?s peace process and development is
essential for achieving sustainable progress.

latest fighting and at the escalation of the conflict in
Afghanistan. We have always held the view that there is
no military solution to this conflict, and that only a
political settlement aimed at the establishment of a fully
representative, broad-based transitional government, can
lead to peace and reconciliation. We therefore call on all
factions to agree an immediate ceasefire and enter
negotiations under United Nations auspices."

the Afghan people and adds to their misery, while human
rights, fundamental freedoms and__ international
humanitarian law continue to be violated with impunity.
We are deeply concerned at new reports of the killing,
harassment and displacement of innocent civilians. The
European Union is particularly concerned about the
situation of the civilian population of the Hazarajat
region, where tens of thousands have already been at risk
as a result of severe food shortages in the last few
months. We are very anxious about the consequences of
the latest fighting for the Hazara and strongly urge the
Taliban to refrain from all acts of indiscriminate violence,
especially against civilians, and from using humanitarian
aid as a weapon against the civilian population."

attack against two staff members of the United Nations
Special Mission to Afghanistan on 21 August 1998 in
Kabul, which caused the death of an Italian national and
left a French national injured. The European Union urges
the Taliban in Kabul to take immediate steps to
investigate this heinous crime and to keep the United
Nations informed of the results of the investigation, as
requested by the Secretary-General in his statement of 24
August [press release SG/SM/6681]. The European Union
reiterates its strong concern for the security of United
Nations personnel, other related personnel, and personnel
of non-governmental organizations in Afghanistan, and

Vienna Conventions on Diplomatic Relations and on
Consular Relations have universal effect and are to be
observed under all circumstances. The European Union
urges all parties concerned, in particular the Taliban, to
help in finding these missing people and in securing their
safe passage out of Afghanistan."
346,Afghanistan_Situation_285202,10,,,,,,,,"The European Union strongly deplores the fact that
third parties, instead of using their influence on the warring
factions to support the efforts of the United Nations to
restore peace, continue to interfere in Afghanistan?€?s internal
affairs in a destructive manner by supplying the factions
with weapons, fuel, arms, ammunition and other materials
for military use. We are also concerned by reports of
involvement of military personnel from outside the country."
347,Afghanistan_Situation_285202,11,,,,,,,,"In this connection, the European Union wishes to
reaffirm its strong commitment to the sovereignty,
independence, territorial integrity and national unity of
Afghanistan. It strongly urges that all kinds of strategic and
military support to Afghan factions, including involvement
of foreign military personnel, must cease. Furthermore, the
European Union considers it imperative that all countries
with an influence on the parties should exercise this
influence in a positive and constructive manner, in support
of the United Nations peace efforts. We also continue to
enforce the embargo on the export of arms, munitions and
military equipment provided for in the European Union?€?s
Common Position of 17 December 1996 on Afghanistan
and urge other countries to adopt a similar policy of
restraint."

various restrictions of access imposed on United Nations
humanitarian agencies and international humanitarian
organizations which have been operating in Afghanistan,
and in particular by the measures which the Taliban have
taken in this regard. We deplore the decision by the Taliban
in Kabul to forcefully close the offices of international non-
governmental organizations, expel foreign workers and
imprison non-governmental organizations?€? local personnel.
These decisions have forced the non-governmental
organizations to abandon their much-needed help for the

reasons I have mentioned, the European Commission had
to suspend common funding by the Community for

through years of suffering and conflict, and we earnestly
desire to continue helping them. However, aid can
continue only where it can be delivered in an effective
and principled manner, without discrimination, and where
humanitarian organizations are able to carry out their
work freely and safely. In this regard, the European
Union fully supports United Nations efforts to resolve the
crisis in Kabul and to ensure adequate conditions for the
delivery of aid, in cooperation with other international
humanitarian organizations."

Afghanistan, the European Union urges all Afghan parties
to support and participate in these programmes.
Furthermore, the European Union reiterates its appeal to
the Afghan factions to put a complete halt to the use of
landmines, which continue to take a very heavy toll on
innocent civilians.

The European Union remains gravelly concerned at
persistent human rights violations and breaches of
humanitarian law in Afghanistan. We are also deeply
concerned about the situation of displaced persons in the
country, whose number is growing."

particular the Taliban, to recognize, protect and promote
all human rights and fundamental freedoms ?€? including
the right to life, liberty and security of persons ?€? and to
respect fully the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
which has been repeatedly endorsed by the international
community, including Afghanistan."

discrimination against girls and women in Afghanistan.
We urge Afghan factions, in particular the Taliban, to end
discriminatory policies and to recognize, protect and
promote the equal rights and dignity of men and women,
including access to education and health facilities,
employment outside the home, personal security and
freedom from intimidation and harassment. The European
Union will continue to point out the implications of
discriminatory policies on the distribution of aid."

Afghanistan and to participate in and support international
efforts to combat terrorism."

Let me also, in conclusion, reiterate the European
Union?€?s continuing commitment to use all its influence to
bring about a sustainable peace in Afghanistan, put an end

of the United Nations."

from the conflict in Afghanistan than Pakistan. As a
consequence of continued instability in Afghanistan,
Pakistan today continues to host more than 1.5 million
refugees. We stand almost single-handed in looking after
these refugees, in the face of donor fatigue and the
indifference of the international community to their plight.
Pakistan has also been the victim of terrorism, drug
trafficking and arms smuggling as a result of conditions
inside Afghanistan."
361,Afghanistan_Situation_285202,25,,,,,,,,"Like the Afghans themselves, our dream is to see
peace established in Afghanistan without any further
bloodshed. Pakistan?€?s consistent policy has been the
promotion of a peaceful and negotiated settlement in
Afghanistan. Pakistan has been the only country which
has engaged with all the sides in the conflict."
362,Afghanistan_Situation_285202,26,,,,,,,,"Soon after assuming office in February 1997, the
Prime Minister of Pakistan, Muhammad Nawaz Sharif,
launched an Afghan peace initiative. This culminated in
the meeting of a steering committee in April this year at
Islamabad for the purpose of working out the modalities
for an ulema convention that would discuss the problems
of Afghanistan in accordance with the shariah and the
traditions of the country. While significant progress was
made by the steering committee, the process was derailed
by minor differences among the Afghan parties."

made a number of efforts, together with Iran, under the
aegis of the Organization of the Islamic Conference and
the United Nations. Unfortunately, those efforts did not
yield any positive results."
364,Afghanistan_Situation_285202,28,,,,,,,,"I now turn to some recent developments in
Afghanistan. Pakistan firmly believes that while the
military fortunes or misfortunes of any of the parties are
purely an internal affair of the Afghan people, the new
ground realities cannot be ignored by the international
community. We must be pragmatic in our approach to
and understanding of the situation of profound magnitude
that has emerged.

It is our earnest hope that the countries sharing a
border with Afghanistan, instead of raising alarms over an
imaginary threat, will join Pakistan in promoting peace and
harmony in Afghanistan. We must shed our biases and avail
ourselves of the window of opportunity in seeking a
realistic and practicable solution to the conflict in
Afghanistan."

Afghanistan against alleged terrorist targets are likely to
complicate the situation. This action has caused deep
indignation, irrespective of the motives behind the air
strikes. The violation of the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of Afghanistan cannot but be a matter of grave
concern."
367,Afghanistan_Situation_285202,31,,,,,,,,"Terrorism, and the suffering that is caused by the loss
of innocent lives, is a heinous crime. We condemn the
terrorist acts against the United States embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania, and feel the deepest sympathy for the
bereaved families. Pakistan itself has been a victim of
repeated acts of terrorism, including State-sponsored
terrorism planned and executed from across the border.
Therefore, we stand shoulder to shoulder with the rest of
the world in the firmest condemnation of terrorism in all its
forms and manifestations and in calling for its total
eradication."
368,Afghanistan_Situation_285202,32,,,,,,,,"In dealing with terrorism, recourse to any means other
than established principles and international norms is likely
to have a negative effect. It could spiral out of control and
further complicate matters in a vicious circle of action and
retaliation."
369,Afghanistan_Situation_285202,33,,,,,,,,"It is a historical fact that the people of Afghanistan
have never tolerated foreign interference in their internal
affairs. Nor have they ever pardoned those who have
violated their sovereignty and territorial integrity. The result
of any adventurism or mis-adventurism, therefore, would be
no different from that of the earliest invasions.

Pakistan has always respected the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Afghanistan. Some countries and
Government-controlled media have recently launched an
orchestrated campaign of vilification against Pakistan,

categorically rejected any involvement in the internal
affairs of Afghanistan. I should like to reiterate our
rejection of these allegations as ridiculous and baseless."
370,Afghanistan_Situation_285202,34,,,,,,,,"We reject any finger-pointing aimed at deflecting the
ground realities. In the recent past, our diplomatic
missions and personnel in Kabul and Mazar-e-Sharif have
come under severe attack. The Pakistan Embassy in
Kabul was burnt, and the Consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif
was ransacked. We lost one of our Embassy personnel.
Our Ambassador in Kabul was manhandled. We did not
point an accusing finger at any country. Similarly, we
deplore any vilification campaign targeted at Pakistan."
371,Afghanistan_Situation_285202,35,,,,,,,,"Pakistan is deeply concerned over the reported
disappearance of some Iranian diplomats from Mazar-e-
Sharif. At the request of Iran, we have approached the
Kabul authorities at the highest level. However, I must
stress that Pakistan's role and ability to ensure the safety
of the Iranian diplomats must not be overestimated,
particularly because we did not have any presence in
Mazar-e-Sharif at the time it was captured by the Kabul
forces."
372,Afghanistan_Situation_285202,36,,,,,,,,"The time has now come for the international
community to engage with the authorities in Kabul. The
United Nations must come to terms with the ground
realities in Afghanistan. It must increase its credibility as
a mediator. Hence, there is now an urgent need for the
opening of an effective channel of communication with
the true representatives of Afghanistan and its people.
Their views must be heard."
373,Afghanistan_Situation_285202,37,,,,,,,,"The people of Afghanistan are in need of substantial
humanitarian supplies to sustain their lives. The
international community must listen to the cry of the
distressed people of that country. The United Nations
agencies and the Member States must provide, on a
priority basis, all possible financial, technical and material
assistance without any preconditions. In this regard, we
welcome the recent agreement between the Kabul
authorities and the United Nations facilitating the
resumption of the activities of the United Nations
agencies and the international organizations in most parts
of Afghanistan, including Kabul."

responsibility in helping the Afghans to rebuild their war-

In conclusion, Pakistan appeals to the international
community to accord formal recognition to the Government
in Kabul. The Afghanistan seat at the United Nations must
be assumed by the true representatives of the people of that
country. The non-existing regime of northern Afghanistan
should cease to occupy the United Nations seat forthwith."

376,Afghanistan_Situation_285202,40,,,,,,,,"Mr. Alimov (Tajikistan) (interpretation from Russian):
The Republic of Tajikistan has actively supported the idea
of the adoption of a special resolution of the Security
Council on Afghanistan and is one of the co-sponsors of
the draft. We welcome the Council?€?s readiness to discuss
the dangerous development of the situation in Afghanistan
and possible steps to redress it.

It is by no means a matter of indifference to Tajikistan
as to the kind of situation that has existed recently in
neighbouring Afghanistan in connection with the approach
of hostilities directly to our border."
377,Afghanistan_Situation_285202,41,,,,,,,,"Our concern derives from an analysis of the real facts.
The leadership of the Taliban movement has been banking
on a military solution to the Afghan problem with the direct
and massive support from outside, and this cannot fail to be
a source of apprehension regarding possible armed actions
by the Taliban on the Tajik-Afghan border. We are
profoundly concerned over the reports from Afghanistan
regarding new, glaring violations of human rights and
international law there, including international humanitarian
law. We do not exclude the possibility of an uncontrollable
surge of Afghan refugees into our country. We are seriously
concerned by the genuine transformation of Afghanistan
into an exporter of terrorism and drugs."
378,Afghanistan_Situation_285202,42,,,,,,,,"We are convinced that the recent events in the north
of Afghanistan confirm the timeliness of the decision to
establish a Russia-Tajikistan-Uzbekistan ?€?troika?€? to
counteract religious extremism. Support from the territory
of the Islamic State of Afghanistan of various types of
extremist forces in Tajikistan can have a highly negative
effect on the peace process in our country."

Commonwealth of Independent States, we are doing
everything in our power to protect our common interests
and security."
380,Afghanistan_Situation_285202,44,,,,,,,,"We agree with many of the assessments of the
present situation in Afghanistan. For our part, we would
like to emphasize that the recent events in Afghanistan
have time and again clearly highlighted the impossibility
of resolving the Afghan conflict by force. No matter how
impressive military victories of one or another of the
parties to the conflict may seem, they can only lead to a
new, more dangerous and even harsher spiral of armed
confrontation and make even more remote the prospects
for the establishment of peace and _ stability in
Afghanistan."
381,Afghanistan_Situation_285202,45,,,,,,,,"We believe that in the present situation, the United
Nations must, in fact, reaffirm its leading role in efforts
to settle the Afghan crisis. There is a need for urgent,
practical steps on the part of the United Nations aimed at
stepping up assistance for a peaceful settlement in
Afghanistan."
382,Afghanistan_Situation_285202,46,,,,,,,,"Tajikistan, as a member of the group of neighbours
and friends of Afghanistan, the Six plus Two group, is
ready to support those efforts and to do everything in its
power to see that the Afghan groups immediately reach
agreement on a ceasefire and engage in serious
negotiations under the aegis of the United Nations on
ways to achieve a peaceful settlement to the conflict on
the basis of the decisions of the Security Council and the
General Assembly."
383,Afghanistan_Situation_285202,47,,,,,,,,"In our view, there is now a need to hold in the
region high-level meetings of representatives of States
members of the Six plus Two group, at which it will be
possible to consider a concrete plan for a settlement to the
conflict. Tajikistan could render the necessary assistance
in holding such a meeting.

In our view, the resolution being adopted today by
the Security Council contains a powerful political
momentum which should exert the appropriate impact on
all of the Afghan parties and on the States on which it

386,Afghanistan_Situation_285202,50,,,,,,,,"Mr. Saha (India): It is my privilege to address the
Security Council under your presidency, Sir.

I'll begin by conveying our deep sympathy for the
people of Afghanistan. The continuing war has brought
immense suffering to them for almost two decades. The
fighting which took place this summer, despite appeals and
warmings from the international community, has
compounded their misery. We are disturbed by reports that
human rights have been violated on a large scale, in
particular through the killing of children, women and
POWs. We expect that the next report of the Secretary-
General will give us a fuller picture of what has so far
appeared in snatches in the media."
387,Afghanistan_Situation_285202,51,,,,,,,,"Peace and stability in Afghanistan are in our security
interest, as they are for almost all of Afghanistan?€?s
neighbours. We have always respected the unity,
independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of
Afghanistan. We are particularly concerned, therefore, that
all the evidence points to a de facto invasion of Afghanistan
by foreign military forces, in support of the Taliban. It also
worries us that the fighting is both exploiting and
heightening ethnic differences. If this continues, the unity
and independence of Afghanistan will be in danger, and if
Afghanistan unravels, the impact will be felt throughout the
region."
388,Afghanistan_Situation_285202,52,,,,,,,,"There is an Afghan personality which transcends
ethnic consciousness. The international community must
sustain and strengthen that personality, not widen ethnic
cleavages. A genuine power-sharing arrangement in which
all Afghan people are represented must take hold if peace
is to return. Territorial gains won through force, trickery or
bribery will be short lived if the people who live there are
alienated or, as has increasingly been the case, brutalized."
389,Afghanistan_Situation_285202,53,,,,,,,,"There have been many debates in the Council, in the
General Assembly and in meetings organized by the United

foreign interference, through the provision of arms,
supplies and advisers to the warring factions, and of late,
through the direct participation in the fighting of foreign
military personnel?"
391,Afghanistan_Situation_285202,55,,,,,,,,"The anarchy in Afghanistan has drawn terrorist
groups to it. Though the events of the last few weeks
have brought international focus to this aspect of the
Afghan problem, for years it has been known that the
most ruthless terrorist organizations have used
Afghanistan as a base to recruit, train and harbour
operatives who were sent out to carry out atrocities
abroad. The responsibility for allowing the Afghan
territory to be used for training international terrorists
falls on those who give them sanctuary."
392,Afghanistan_Situation_285202,56,,,,,,,,"This is an issue of particular concern to us, as India
has been the victim of state-sponsored, cross-border
terrorism in a most vicious form. We have, on many
occasions, drawn the world's attention to the presence of
the training camps in our immediate neighbourhood, in
Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and Afghanistan, where
terrorists are trained and equipped to carry out merciless,
violent and subversive activities in India, in particular in
the state of Jammu and Kashmir. The international
community has unfortunately been silent or indifferent to
these developments and unable to agree on concerted
efforts to tackle the menace of international terrorism, in
our region or elsewhere."
393,Afghanistan_Situation_285202,57,,,,,,,,"The crisis in Afghanistan has three main elements.
The first is the continuing war, fomented and sustained by
foreign interference. The second is that Afghanistan has
been turned into a haven for international terrorism. The
third is the lack of respect for international norms and
human rights in the areas controlled by the Taliban."
394,Afghanistan_Situation_285202,58,,,,,,,,"On the first element, the countries that have
instigated and participated in the Afghan fighting should
realize that a resolution can come only through peaceful
means, in direct negotiations between Afghan factions
under United Nations auspices, aimed at achieving
mutually acceptable solutions that accommodate the rights
and interests of all ethnic, religious and political groups
of Afghan society. These countries should encourage the
factions whom they support to return to the negotiating
table without delay and preconditions, and cooperate with
the aim of creating a broad-based and fully representative
Government which would protect the rights of all"

Afghanistan.

On the second issue, the international community
perhaps now realizes the magnitude and the ramifications
of the problem caused by the presence and activities of
foreign mercenaries and their foreign patrons, who have not
only destabilized Afghanistan but also made it a seminary
for international terrorists. However, selective unilateral
action cannot solve the problem of international terrorism.
Only an effective international cooperative effort to identify
and act against those responsible for international
terrorism ?€? whether individual terrorist groups or States ?€?
will succeed."
396,Afghanistan_Situation_285202,60,,,,,,,,"On the third issue, a condemnation of the violation of
international norms of conduct is not sufficient. The
international community must act together now to mobilize
the human rights machinery to ensure the observance of
internationally recognized human rights in all of
Afghanistan. The perpetrators of gross and systematic
violations of human rights must not be given the
international legitimacy they crave. This would be an
appropriate message to convey as we prepare to
commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights."

Council and the General Assembly, the efforts of the
Secretary-General and his Special Envoy for the rejection
of further bloodshed and the attempt to find a political
settlement in which the views of all Afghan people are
taken into account. The international concern also stems
from the recognition of the time-honoured fact that
Afghanistan, as a country with a multi-ethnic,
multicultural and fiercely independent population, cannot
be ruled by a single group, particularly when that group
is widely believed to have been organized, supported and
patronized by foreign powers."
401,Afghanistan_Situation_285202,65,,,,,,,,"The Afghan people have made it amply clear in their
history that they will not tolerate direct or indirect foreign
domination, no matter what the cost. This is where the
problem lies. Otherwise, it should make little difference
to Afghanistan's neighbours or to the rest of the world
which group rules the country as long as it respects the
basic principles of human rights and the rules of inter-
State relations."

continue to believe that the problem in Afghanistan has
no military solution and that persisting to seek a military
victory will only perpetuate the internecine violence in
that war-torn country and will fail, and fail miserably, to
bring peace and normalcy to the deserving people of
Afghanistan. In our opinion as a neighbour, even if the
Taliban succeed in getting control of the entire land of
Afghanistan, they will not be able to rule over all the
Afghan people, who are of different ethnic backgrounds
and political and religious persuasions. Unfortunately,
therefore, the problems in Afghanistan will continue to
plague the Afghan people, the region and elsewhere."

people and for the region ?€? about their independence and
future agenda. The reports of foreign assistance to the
Taliban in the form not only of the supply of arms and

to massive starvation and death; the unbridled cultivation of

and instigation of terrorist elements and _ terrorist

like to see continue its proud heritage of political
independence and non-alignment. The fate of Afghanistan
will be determined by the Afghan people themselves. They
will have to make the political decision to opt for peace.
Peace cannot be imposed on Afghanistan from abroad or by
outside forces. In this connection, the Islamic Republic of
Iran, like most other neighbours of Afghanistan and the rest

Consulate-General of the Islamic Republic of Iran in
Mazar-e-Sharif, of the correspondent of the Islamic
Republic News Agency and of many Iranian relief

Consulate-General and the abduction of its personnel by
the Taliban have been condemned by many States as
gross violations of the basic principles and recognized
norms of international law."

S/1998/776 of 19 August 1998, in which the
circumstances of the capture of the Consulate by the

taped conversation between the head of our
Consulate-General in Mazar-e-Sharif and the Foreign
Ministry in Tehran when the Consulate was captured by
the Taliban forces at 14.30 hours on 8 August is
available. The sound of automatic-rifle fire can clearly be
heard in the background.

I wish to stress that the continued detention of the
Iranian nationals by the Taliban is unacceptable to the
Islamic Republic of Iran. We certainly hope that the
demand by the Security Council for their immediate
release and safe and dignified passage out of Afghanistan
is heeded by them. We call upon other Governments to
